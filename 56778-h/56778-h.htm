</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The theme of the present volume is throughout the
conquest of Manila by the British in 1762, and events consequent to it.
The various accounts we have drawn from both Spanish and English
sources, in order that we might present the matter from the standpoints
of each nation, and we have aimed to give the story in great detail
from as many points of view as possible. The subject must have special
interest for Americans by reason of the operations of 1898. In some
measure the captures by both the British and the Americans are
analogous, because in each case it was rather a side demonstration than
the main object of the war, and because of the ease with which it was
accomplished. Here, however, the analogy ends, for British occupation
was at the best precarious while it lasted, and made scarcely any
headway outside of Manila; and while naturally the questions of
religion, commerce, and civil affairs generally were discussed, nothing
lasting was done. It may well be that the ease with which Manila was
taken by the British gave the Filipinos some idea, though slight, of
separation from Spain, or a desire for a larger degree of independence;
although, in truth, all such ideas appeared to be effectively stifled
with the strengthening power of the religious orders. Of special
interest will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>be found the operations of Anda y Salazar, a true
patriot, though like the Count de Frontenac, of Canada, of a hasty and
impetuous nature; and his contest with the incapable archbishop. It is
to be noted throughout that all English dates are one day in advance of
the Spanish dates, as the English had the same dates as the Portuguese,
who reached the Orient by way of the Eastern route. This is a momentous
period in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>The first document in this volume consists of a plan outlined by an
unknown writer, but one who has been among the Philippines (and who is,
perhaps, General Draper), for the conquest of the southern islands,
evidently received at London November 23, 1762&mdash;a good prelude to
the conquest of Manila. Weighing the arguments as to the expediency of
such a conquest, the author decides in favor of it, as the silver which
is taken from the Philippines to India in the Manila-India trade, and
which comes direct from America, will pass to India direct from the
latter country if the islands are conquered. The present plan, however,
does not contemplate the reduction of Manila. The islands could be held
either permanently or only until the conclusion of peace, the
advisability of taking them to rest upon either one of the following
reasons: that they are important enough to meet the expenses of the
expedition; or that the enemy can be harassed thence. The chief end for
which Spain holds the Philippines is religious, and if the missions are
considered, Manila might be ceded, though if that does not happen, the
holding of them will be an important item in the peace conclusions.
Operations carried on among the southern islands would have especial
point, for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>Spaniards would fear an alliance between the
restless Moros and the enemy. The Spaniards care only about the
Acapulco galleon and do not trouble themselves about the rest of the
islands, which are governed badly. The natives, in danger from Moro
raids, are ripe for revolt. Proceeding directly to a consideration of
the southern islands, the writer names and describes the most important
of them, making use to some extent, in his description, of Colin and
San Antonio. The population that the British would receive by such a
conquest would be an advantage. The expedition should proceed first
against the fort of Zamboanga, which can be easily taken, and then
abandoned and demolished or left in charge of the present Spanish
garrison if they will take the oath of allegiance. Next the forts of
the islands of Misamis and Ceb&uacute; should be taken, both of which
are important. They can count upon the help of the Moros, and of the
Boholans, the latter of whom are now in revolt. All this can be done
with one European ship with about fifty soldiers, and several smaller
ships, the best time for the expedition being the northeast
monsoon.</p>
<p>This is followed by two letters by Admiral Cornish to one Mr.
Clevland, evidently some secretary in the office of the Admiralty. In
the first letter, dated October 6, 1762, Admiral Cornish reports the
success in the operations against Manila, which has fallen on the sixth
of October, and gives a short account of the expedition. After
hastening preparations for the expedition as rapidly as possible, he
sends Commodore Tiddeman with five vessels from Madras to Malacca on
the twenty-ninth of July. He himself following with all but two of the
remaining vessels on August <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>1, reaches Malacca on the nineteenth,
but Tiddeman fails to appear until the twenty-first because of calms.
Leaving Malacca on the twenty-seventh, the fleet makes the coast of
Luz&oacute;n, September 19, but owing to rough weather is unable to
enter the bay of Manila until the twenty-third. Cornish and Draper,
abandoning the previous plan to attack Cavite first, resolve to proceed
directly against Manila, as that once taken, Cavite must also fall.
Accordingly troops are landed on the twenty-fifth through a heavy surf,
and occupy Moratta (Malate) one and one-half miles from the walls. That
same day also Cornish despatches three vessels to capture a sail that
is seen coming up the bay, which when captured is found to be a vessel
with the mail and news of the Acapulco galleon &ldquo;Filipino,&rdquo;
which has itself remained behind at Cagayan. On the twenty-sixth
Draper&rsquo;s forces take up a position two hundred feet from the
glacis of the Manila wall, and Cornish lands 700 seamen to aid them.
Under cover of the fire from the ships Draper works on his batteries.
The entrenching tools, of which there is great need, are supplied by
the timely arrival of the storeship, although the latter is driven
ashore by the heavy sea. Draper opens with his batteries on October 4,
and to so good a purpose that the combined forces are enabled to make
the assault on the morning of the sixth, in which they carry everything
before them. Draper and Cornish immediately go ashore to make
arrangements with the governor. The surrender of Manila and Cavite, and
the islands and forts dependent on the former, is agreed upon; and in
addition the payment of 4,000,000 dollars or pesos as a ransom to the
English for the preservation of the city. Cornish&rsquo;s ship captain,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>Kempenfelt, takes possession of Cavite on the
tenth. In that place are gained abundance of naval stores, and fresh
food is secured. The men have borne themselves well through the short
fatiguing siege, and land and sea forces have maintained harmonious
relations. Cornish encloses a list of the ships with the seamen and
marines landed from each one, and of those killed and wounded during
the siege. This shows a landing force of 1,017&mdash;17 killed, and 17
wounded. The letter of November 10 reports the capture of the
&ldquo;Sant&iacute;sima Trinidad&rdquo; by two vessels detached for
that purpose. This large vessel, which had sailed for Acapulco some
time before with a rich cargo, but has been obliged to put back, is
taken to be the &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; which is expected from Acapulco
with the situado, until actually boarded. For the present it is
anchored at Corregidor Island, but Cornish purposes to send for it
soon.</p>
<p>In a letter from Cornish addressed to the famous Lord Anson, the
former mentions the great advantages that accrue to his fleet in the
possession of Cavite, for he can obtain all needed supplies and food,
and can repair his ships, some of which are unseaworthy. He complains
bitterly of the East India Company, whose <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e425" title="Source: employes">employees</span> at Madras, with
the exception of but one, have endeavored to obstruct the expedition in
every way. The two companies of troops furnished by the company are
composed of French deserters and released prisoners. Further
information can be secured from Captain Kempenfelt, the bearer of his
despatches, who is also in charge of some engraved plates containing a
map (the famous one by Murillo Velarde) of the islands.</p>
<p>Letters from General Draper to the Earl of Egremont, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>dated
November 1 and 2, respectively, are practically duplicates, the first
appearing to be the rough draft of the second. They announce the taking
of Manila on October 6, and praise the bravery and forbearance of the
men who acted with great humanity, notwithstanding that Draper&rsquo;s
own secretary is killed under a flag of truce. In company with Cornish,
Draper dictates the conditions under which Manila will be preserved
from pillage, which are accepted by the Spanish. The East India Company
is to have one-third of the ransom. Manila and Cavite have been
delivered to the Company&rsquo;s representative, as per orders. It
would be well to hold Manila and the islands, if possible, for they are
very wealthy. The season and the need of repairing the ships prevent
the taking possession of the other places ceded. Draper praises highly
Admiral Cornish, his officers, and the seamen and marines for their
efficiency, as well as his own officers and men, especially the 79th
regiment. Following these letters are three sets of
&ldquo;proposals&rdquo; and &ldquo;conditions,&rdquo; all dated October
6. The first, consisting of 12 &ldquo;proposals&rdquo; made by the
archbishop-governor and others, touches rights of property, religion,
trade, residence, and government; all the proposals are granted by the
conquerors, but some of them with certain reservations. The second set,
consisting of the four &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; under which Manila will
be preserved from pillage, is proposed by the British and accepted. The
latter outline the status of the Spanish officers and men, who are all
to be regarded as prisoners of war. All military stores must be
surrendered, as well as Cavite and other places dependent on Manila. In
addition a ransom of 4,000,000 dollars or pesos is to be paid, half
immediately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>and the balance at some future date, for which
hostages are to be given. The third set, consisting of
&ldquo;proposals,&rdquo; and also submitted by the British, relates to
the surrender of Cavite, and the method of payment of the ransom.</p>
<p>The important journal of the British operations, kept by General
Draper, and sent with his letter of November 2, follows. The first part
of the journal is rather general in nature, while the latter part is
more specific and definite; but as a whole it well supplements the
preceding letters by Cornish and Draper. The troops, consisting of the
79th regiment, a company of royal artillery, 30 artillerymen furnished
by the East India Company, 2 companies of Frenchmen, also furnished by
the Company, 600 Sepoys, and other natives, and re&euml;nforced by
Cornish&rsquo;s seamen and marines, a total of 2,300 men, sail July 29
and August 1 for Malacca, where they are to water, taking precautions
on the way to prevent the Spaniards from learning of the expedition.
Malacca is left August 27, and the fleet anchors in Manila Bay
September 23, completely surprising the Spaniards. A summons to the
governor on the twenty-fourth elicits no satisfactory reply, and,
accordingly, operations are begun immediately. From that date until
October 6, when Manila is taken by easy assault, the siege is one of
ceaseless activity on the part of the British, who struggle against
heavy seas and rains which aid the Spaniards. The latter, 800 strong,
are re&euml;nforced by 10,000 Pampangos, &ldquo;a fierce and barbarous
people.&rdquo; To the latter is due the killing, under a flag of truce,
of Draper&rsquo;s secretary, Lieutenant Fryar, who is sent to the
Spanish lines with a nephew of the archbishop-governor who has been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>captured with a vessel despatched from the
Acapulco galleon. This has arrived on the Luz&oacute;n coast in
September, with news of the war, and Cornish endeavors to capture it.
The British base of land operations is the suburb of Malate, from which
successive advances are made, although a few sallies by Spaniards and
Pampangos give the British forces considerable trouble. The Pampangos,
however, meet with so severe losses, that becoming disheartened, all
but 1,800 of them desert. The British landing force, consisting of both
troops and seamen and marines, is well supported by the ships. At the
assault, one hundred Spaniards and natives who refuse to surrender are
all killed. The archbishop-governor and his chief officers retire to
the citadel and surrender at discretion. The officers are allowed to
give their parole, but all natives are simply dismissed. When Cavite is
surrendered, three hundred Spanish troops mutiny and desert with their
arms. The total number of Spanish officers and men, taken prisoners,
both of the army and navy, amounts to 361. The British loss, as shown
by an appended list, is 36 killed, and 111 wounded. Many war supplies
are captured in Manila and Cavite, a goodly proportion of which is
unserviceable.</p>
<p>This is followed by the journal of the archbishop of the defense and
assault of Manila, from the appearance of the British in Manila Bay,
September 22, until the capture of Manila October fifth. It differs in
some of its details from Draper&rsquo;s journal, especially in the
number of the British forces, and the number of the British killed
(both undoubtedly exaggerations on the part of the archbishop), and
gives details not mentioned by Draper. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>This is followed by a valuable series of documents (mainly in
synopsis) concerning Simon de Anda y Salazar, the patriotic auditor,
and the English invasion. The various letters, etc., consist of
communications between Anda and the weak archbishop, Rojo; Anda and the
British; the archbishop and the Filipinos; and the British and Diego
Silang, the insurgent. By means of them one may follow fairly
accurately the course of events after the taking of Manila. Throughout,
Anda&rsquo;s tone is one of intense bitterness toward the archbishop,
whom he accuses of venality and collusion with the British. The
archbishop, on the contrary, accuses Anda, whom the British proscribe,
of usurping power not his own, and of lack of patriotism. The abortive
Chinese insurrection, instigated by the British, is put down by Anda
with terrible vengeance. There are charge and countercharge between
Anda and the British (whose proscription Anda has met) of inhumanity,
each side striving to clear itself from such an imputation. Anda is
slow to accept the assurances of peace, and to grant a truce to
hostilities, for he fears some British treachery. He demands that they
leave the islands, in accordance with the terms of the treaty (made in
February 1763), and by which they should have left the islands in
August 1763. Early in 1764, the treaty is sent on a British vessel
which also carries orders for the British to go to the Coromandel
coast; with which the Spaniards are left in peaceful possession of the
islands.</p>
<p>The archbishop-governor writes a long relation of events (probably
in 1763) preceding and following the assault by the British, in which
his chief aim is to justify his own conduct, as many charges have been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>preferred against him. He has been mindful of the
peace and harmony of the islands, has healed breaches, has encouraged
agriculture, has looked after the defense of the islands, and increased
the navy. The repair of the public works has engrossed a part of his
attention, but his plans are not to be perfected, for the English spoil
that. He has also bettered the condition of the treasury; and in view
of the fact that the whole concern of the people is centered about the
annual trading galleon, has tried to improve the lethargy, idleness,
and vice into which they fall when that matter is attended to. He
relates the story of the siege and assault, and the dispositions of the
British, and the general events of the period immediately following.
Throughout he justifies his own conduct, as in the letters to Anda,
recounting his troubles with various Spanish officials, the British,
and Anda. He protests that he has acted only for the interests of the
Spanish monarch, and indignantly repels the idea that he has been in
collusion with the British. This is in many ways an especially
interesting document, and supplements the information of the other
documents considerably.</p>
<p>In a letter to King C&aacute;rlos III, dated June 22, 1764, Anda
relates the measures taken by him in his office as Audiencia, governor
and captain-general. These measures cover a wide range, extending to
things social, economic, moral, and religious. A fixed tariff for
provisions, etc., the coinage, the Chinese, who are allied with the
British, the military, the seculars, the surveillance and care of the
Filipinos, the churches, agriculture, proscription of certain British
officers, the curfew, prohibition of gambling games, regulation of the
sale of intoxicants, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21"
name="pb21">21</a>]</span>and strict regulations regarding
theft&mdash;all these engage his attention.</p>
<p>Another letter from Anda to C&aacute;rlos III, dated July 23, 1764,
is devoted entirely to the archbishop, who is characterized as wanting
in loyalty. Anda, while protesting his own loyalty and devotion to the
crown of Spain, declares the many acts of the archbishop (who is now
dead) during and after the assault. The latter has written violent
letters to Anda, and has acted entirely in the interests of the
British. His boon companions have been the traitors Orendain and
Fallet, by whom he has been influenced to sign the cession of the
islands. Anda has been proscribed at his instigation as a rebel, but
that cannot be, as he has never consented to become a vassal of the
British, and his loyalty to the Spanish monarch is known. Although the
archbishop was urged <span class="corr" id="xd27e454" title=
"Not in source">to</span> give up his foolish pretensions to the
governorship, he would never do so. That position rightfully belonged
to Anda after the assault, and even the British always spoke of the
archbishop as the ex-governor. The latter&rsquo;s want of loyalty is
exemplified by his refusal to send the royal seal to Anda, though he
could easily have done so.</p>
<p>Baltasar Vela, <abbr title="Society of Jesus">S.J.</abbr>, of
Manila, writes his nephew, Brother Antonio Gonzalez, <abbr title=
"Society of Jesus">S.J.</abbr>, of Madrid, July 24, 1764, informing him
that the British have at last left Manila, after a rule there of
eighteen months. That city fell because of the lack of political sense
of the Spaniards and their insufferable pride, for it could have been
easily defended, as it is impregnable almost by its location alone. Its
loss he charges to the methods of Spanish traitors who won over the
archbishop, so that it was arranged that everything <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>should
be left open for the assault by the British on the fifth of October.
There was no breach made in the walls, he affirms, but the British
soldiers scaled them by means of holes in the soft stone. The attempt
to kill Anda was arranged by the traitors with the Chinese and British.
The latter were aided throughout by the traitorous Spaniards, the
Chinese, and the natives whom they manage to corrupt; but most of their
plans outside Manila come to nought. The letter closes with several
personal matters, among them a request for reading matter.</p>
<p>A series of representations, forty-six in all, made by Anda and
Francisco de la Torre (governor <i lang="la">ad interim</i>) in June
and July of 1764, treat in part of the matters covered in preceding
documents. Notices are given of the insurrections in Ilocos and
Pangasinan, both of which have been instigated and aided by the
British, and both of which are finally put down, the latter with the
aid of Bishop Ustariz. Anda praises the religious orders, especially
the Augustinians, although he notes that some of the religious of St.
John of God have been discontented. Jol&oacute; affairs and the British
alliance with the king of that island are discussed briefly. Orendain,
who has been disloyal to the king, has gone with his family to Madras
with the English. The fines imposed upon Villacorta and Viana do not
appear to have been rightly adjudged. Torre asks that a rule be given
regulating the conduct of the single member left to represent the
Audiencia, as in the case of Anda, should such a contingency again
occur. Anda&rsquo;s conduct deserves only complete and hearty
approval.</p>
<p>Two declarations are presented by General Draper (both probably in
1764), in which he protests <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=
"#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>against the charges of inhumanity
that have been brought against him in regard to the affair at Manila,
and urges the payment of the remainder of the ransom which the
Spaniards refuse. The Spaniards charge the British with breaking the
agreements of the capitulation, but it is they themselves who have
broken them all. By various subterfuges they have endeavored and are
endeavoring to escape the payment of the ransom. Less than one-half
million dollars of the four millions have as yet been paid. The story
of the siege and subsequent events is in part gone over, including some
little of Anda&rsquo;s operation. The action of the East India Company,
to whom the city was turned over shortly after the assault, causes the
captors to lose about 200,000 dollars. The second declaration is made
necessary because of the new arguments put forward by the Spanish to
evade payment of the ransom bills given on the Spanish treasury at the
capitulation of Manila. The British have a right to that city until all
the ransom has been paid.</p>
<p>A short letter from Eugenio Carrion, <abbr title=
"Society of Jesus">S.J.</abbr>, to Joseph de Rueda, <abbr title=
"Society of Jesus">S.J.</abbr>, written from San Pedro Macati, July 8,
1765, notes the conclusion of peace and the arrival of a new
proprietary governor, Francisco Raon. Francisco de la Torre, governor
<i lang="la">ad interim</i>, has left Manila in a good state of defense
and has begun operations against the Moros, which will doubtless be
continued by Raon. This will make the trade of the Visayan Islands
flourishing once more. In their retirement from the islands the British
have lost one-half their boats and men, the latter numbering in all
8,000. News of the Chinese affairs will have been received through the
Portuguese fathers. There are still about thirty fathers in that
empire, ten or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>eleven of whom live openly in Pekin, while the
others are in hiding. Carrion prays that the Society may safely weather
the storm (the approaching suppression) that has assailed it as a
whole.</p>
<p>The last of this series of documents is a letter from Bernardo
Pazuengos, <abbr title="Society of Jesus">S.J.</abbr>, the Philippine
provincial, to Joaquin Mesquida, <abbr title=
"Society of Jesus">S.J.</abbr>, the procurator-general, written from
Santa Cruz. The first part of the letter, dated June 17, 1765,
complains of Francisco de la Torre, who has lived as a libertine and
has been especially hostile toward the religious orders. The arrival of
a new governor is awaited eagerly by all the decent inhabitants. The
Jesuits and Dominicans are fully resolved to resign their missions as
existing conditions of affairs will not permit them longer to hold
them. So poor are the fathers, whose stipends are no longer paid, that
they are compelled to make their shoes out of the parchment of their
books. Their missions are heavily in debt. The Moros, and even the
Christians, have raided the missions. The Visayan Islands are ruined,
and one-half their inhabitants have been killed and captured. Jesuit
estates have been burned. The Recollects have escaped no better, in all
probability. Auditor Galban has declared that the pious funds are the
ruin of the islands and of trade. Vigorous measures are being taken
against the Jesuits. The fiscal urges action against all the religious
orders. The arrival of the &ldquo;Santa Rosa&rdquo; with the new
governor on July 3 is noted. The letter finally closes on July 20.</p>

<h2 class="main">PLAN OF AN EXPEDITION FOR THE CONQUEST OF THE SOUTHERN
PHILIPPINES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before we consider this Subject in the View of
Probability Let us examine how far it may be expedient: It is well
known a very lucrative Commerce is carried on from India to Manila
under Sanction of Moorish Colours. It might therefore be alleged that
considerable Disadvantages would accrue to the General Commerce of
India were the Spaniards deprived of the Philippin Islands from a
Presumption that the Silver now received from thence would be
lost<span class="corr" id="xd27e611" title="Not in source">.</span> But
when the footing on which the Spaniards at present admit this Commerce
is duly attended to, It cannot be doubted a quite contrary Effect would
follow.&mdash;Silver is the Produce of the Trade carried on from Manila
to America and if the Spaniards had not Manila America would open her
Arms to the Importers of those Conveniences which India &amp; China
only can afford them: This Navigation might be opend if supported in
time of Open war by a Port on California.</p>
<p>It is true this Circumstance may be reckoned not entirely relative
to the present Plan which does not propose the Conquest of Manila. But
it cannot be deemed quite foreign to the Subject as the Possession
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>of the Southern Islands would be a great restraint
on the Spaniards at Manila.</p>
<p>There are two Reasons fully sufficient to warrant Attacks in war.
The Conquest of a Place important enough to answer the expences of the
Expedition by maintaining it after the war is over or by relinquishing
it at the Conclusion of a Peace on a valuable Consideration &amp;
distressing an Enemy by harassing him in different Quarters &amp;
facilitating any other attempt against him or preventing his acting
offensively: The Expedition here proposed may be considered in either
Light. Certain it is the Chief Motive of the Spaniards for maintaining
these Islands arises from religious Zeal So that admitting the Southern
Islands to be subdued It is far from being impossible that in
Consideration [of] Permission to the Missions Manila itself might then
be ceded &amp; Perhaps Valuable Commercial Priviledges granted also to
Us.</p>
<p>But if the Spaniards should not acquiesce in valuable Cessions for
Permissions to the Missions they must be extremely piqued &amp; alarmed
to have so large a part of their Dominions severd from Manila
particularly as they suffer already greatly from the Inroads of the
Moors and the relinquishing them would undoubtedly be a Point of
Consequence in a Treaty of Peace.</p>
<p>But supposing the Spaniards are so indifferent about them as neither
to give any valuable Consideration in lieu or for Permission to the
Missions, It is necessary to shew the Islands would answer the Charge
of Conquest &amp; be worth maintaining.</p>
<p>However Previous to this we think it most eligible to consider the
Subject in a different Light we mean <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>as it may effect the
War:&mdash;The Philippin Islands are so far severd from the other
Spanish Dominions that any attack of them can have no Influence on
other parts So that Manila only can be affected by the Expedition here
proposed. If there be any attempt intended against the Capital It
undoubtedly would have infinite Good Effect to alarm the out Islands
perhaps in drawing some force from Manila but much to the purpose by
perplexing them with the apprehension of a Junction with the Moors
&amp; Southern Islanders to attack them behind &amp; cut of all
resource by Land &amp; starve them by a Blockade at the same time that
their apprehensions would be justly raised of a General Revolt of the
Indians under their Dominion who tired out with oppressions are weary
of the Spanish Yoke &amp; ripe for Revolt. Some as Bohol have rebelld
&amp; the Tagalas who lye around Manila have implord the Assistance of
Sooloo to protect them in Independance<span class="corr" id="xd27e628"
title="Not in source">.</span> The Spaniards consider nothing but the
Galleons Cargo &amp; Erections Leaving the Moors almost without
Molestation to ravage &amp; spread Distruction thro the Southern
Islands from whence they have carried into Captivity many thousands
within these few Years &amp; have in a manner put an End to Commerce
from the hazard to which Coasting Vessells are exposd. It is no wonder
if the Natives who are still forced to pay Tribute should be ready to
join any Power from whom they may expect Protection.</p>
<p>Besides Luzon which is not at present under Consideration There are
9 considerable Islands.</p>
<p>Paragua of which a part only is under the Spanish
Jurisdiction;&mdash;Mindanao whereof they have&mdash;the sole
Possession on the W. N. &amp; part of the E. Coasts <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>Samar,
Leyte, Bohol, Zibu, Negros, Pany &amp; Mindoro.</p>
<p>The Islands of mean Size are more numerous; Besides Dumaran whereof
part is claimed by Sooloo we may reckon 23 worth naming&mdash;Luban,
Maricaban, Marinduque, Tablas, Romblon Sibuyan, Masbate, Burias, Ticao,
Capul, Catanduan Polo; Maripipi, Panamao, Mactan, Siguyod, Panaon
Guimaras, Cuyo, Lalutaya, Sinacapan, Calamian &amp; Buvugan.</p>
<p>It is proposed to give some account of each of these tho it is not
to be presumed we can treat of each with much or equal Precision.</p>
<p>The Chief Establishment of the Spaniards on Paragua is at Tyty on
the N<sup>o</sup>. End The Fort named S<sup>t</sup>. Isabel de la
Paragua is built a top of a small rocky hill, the further part not a
musquet Shot from the Sea &amp; part of it washed by the waves; It is
built of Stone: They have in the same Province several other small
Forts on the Islands Cuyo, Lalataya, Linapacan &amp; Calamian or Culion
but all these last are only Garrisond by the Natives or Militia &amp;
indeed are only intended for Security against the Inroads of the
Moors.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e650src" href="#xd27e650" name=
"xd27e650src">1</a></p>
<p>The Possession of Tyty seems rather as a Check on the Moors than
from the Number of its Tributarys or Produce at least under its present
Masters; this part of Paragua abounds in excellent Harbours scarce any
exceed that of Tyty but Malampaya on the West Coast: the Island is very
populous but the greatest part are under the Jurisdiction of Sooloo if
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>we consider the whole Island the Productions are
very valuable &amp; by description few surpass it Gold, Cowrees, Rice,
Canes, Rattans, Batata, Kuma False Amber &amp; many other valuable
articles are in abundance It is very populous on the East Side but the
Natives are almost solely Joloan: Their antipathy to the Spaniards
would not probably prevent the English reaping the Benefit of their
Industry &amp; Commerce to the Articles abovementiond we may probably
add Birds Nest as the Calamianes abound in the whitest &amp; as the
Nature of this part of Paragua promises to yield it in abundance.</p>
<p>The two Islands of Calamianes give name to the Province the first
Spanish Establishment having been made there: They are 3 considerable
Islands Linapacan, Calamian &amp; Busvazon<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e662src" href="#xd27e662" name="xd27e662src">2</a> besides a great
Number of small ones on every side. They yield Birds Nest; wax which
they gather twice a year, the Land is rugged &amp; the seas dangerous;
the Natives are bold &amp; industrious &amp; have Rice, Hogs &amp;
Poultry in abundance.</p>
<p>Under the same Jurisdiction are the Islands Cuyo which are 5 in
number close together &amp; contain about 500 Familys. They are docile
&amp; more attached to the Spaniards than the Calamians or Paraguans:
they have abundance of rice, Hogs &amp; Poultry. The whole Jurisdiction
does not seem to contain above 4 or 5000 People.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e667src" href="#xd27e667" name="xd27e667src">3</a></p>
<p>The Islands Leyt&eacute;, Samar &amp; several small ones adjoining
are under the Jurisdiction of the former. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>Samar which is divided from Leyte by the narrow Strait of S. Juanico
lyes on the East of the Philippins. On the Side which looks to the
Ocean it is named Ibabao &amp; that part within is called Samar the
Port of Borongon on the East Side formerly afforded Shelter to the
Galleons from a Dutch Squadron in 1620 &amp; Palapa on the North might
have done the same to the Cabadong<a class="noteref" id="xd27e681src"
href="#xd27e681" name="xd27e681src">4</a> It is entirely sheltered from
all winds &amp; we presume is what Anson&rsquo;s Voyage calls Ialapy
Calbalagan is the Chief Town &amp; residence of the Alcalde; The Island
is very full of fine Timber [<i>word illegible</i>] for Ship
build<sup>g</sup> the country is Rough &amp; Mountainous but its Plains
are fertile in rice wax &amp; abacca of which last they manufacture
Cloth. It in common with the other Philippins abounds in Cattle.</p>
<p>Leyte is more fertile on the East Side where the Plains are so
fertile that the Crops yield 200 fold: a ridge of high Mountains divide
it nearly in the middle which occasions a very great Diversity of
Seasons: So that whilst it is winter on the N. Side (which happens
during the N. E. winds) it is Spring on the South &amp; vice versa. In
the middle they have double Seasons &amp; both good Crops. It has on
all Sides many rivers which fall from these high Mountains &amp; in
these rivers and Seas are great abundance of excellent Fish
particularly the Harbor of Quibot opposite to the Island of Camote.
This Island abounds in fine Timber for Ship Building &amp; Harbours for
their Security. Besides Quibot there are several on the west Coast,
Palompong, Lagnoag, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"
name="pb33">33</a>]</span>Tigas, Leyti, &amp;c. Leyte is the only one
on the N<sup>o</sup>.&mdash;Cacaliaton on the E.&mdash;&amp; on the
S<sup>o</sup>. Liloan formed by this Island &amp; Panaon which strait
is very famous for being the Entrance of Magellan &amp; Legaspi to the
Islands; &amp; there are still remains of some small Guard Houses built
by Legaspi.</p>
<p>The Plains abound with Game as Deer Hogs &amp; Fowls, besides
Domestick ones &amp; the Plenty of Cattle originally brought from
China: It yields Rice wax &amp; Abacca Cloth which is their common
wear. It also abounds in Coconut Trees, &amp; Fruits of various
kinds<span class="corr" id="xd27e705" title="Not in source">.</span>
The People of these two Islands are open &amp; ingenious &amp; the
Climate is cooler than Manila.</p>
<p>Leyte has 19 Towns which contain 45,229 Souls, Liloan 330, Poro
1505, &amp; Samar 53,260 in 17 Towns the whole 100,332. It ought to be
observed indeed that this Numeration was before the late Incursion of
the Moors who for <abbr title="about">ab<sup>t</sup></abbr> 10 years
passed have annually infested the Islands carrying into Captivity
seldom less than 1000 tho chiefly women &amp; Children: So that we
shall suppose they do not now exceed 80,000 altho we presume this
deduction too great as the Number of the Inhabitants of the other
Islands are from so late Information as 1761, &amp; as many of the
Captures have been made from the other Islands particularly the small
ones of whose Inhabitants we have no Numeration &amp; even many from
the Island Luzon which we now consider.</p>
<p>Annexed to the Province of Leyte are several smaller Islands which
in general as well as the two larger abound in Cacao: Panamao also
yields much Sulphur &amp; Maripipi, which affords by report a most
agreeable &amp; remarkable appearance, Plenty of Gold.</p>
<p>Bohol adjoining to Leyte also appertains to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>Province
of Zebu it is a rocky &amp; barren Island of Rice but rich in Mines of
[<i>illegible</i>] a[n]d ores of gold it also yelds Cowries.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e724src" href="#xd27e724" name="xd27e724src">5</a> It
contains 9 Towns which are all situated on the Sea ashore they are
never infested by the Moors being esteemed a valiant People they have
no Forts nor Spaniards on the Island but Jesuit Fathers they have
however enclosd most of their Towns for Security against Invasion: It
is reported they offerd to protect the Islands against the Moorish
Inroads if they were exempted the Tribute But this offer was refused
Undoubtedly it would well answer the expence were they not only freed
from Tribute but paid a ratio of Rice which they obtain by Commerce
with the other Islands, for this Service Some of them are at present
revolted &amp; having killed two Fathers retired into the
Mountains.</p>
<p>They have many tame &amp; wild Hogs &amp; the Seas are full of Fish:
Cotton is in abund<sup>t</sup>. &amp; their women Manufacture it into
fine Cloths. The Natives are whiter &amp; better disposed than their
Neighbours but speak the Bissaya Language. It is pretended the Sooloos
originally came from Bohol or the Natives of it from Sooloo for it is
not well agreed which &amp; not much Probability to support either
opinion. It contains at least 40,000 People.</p>

<p>Zebu the Next Island to Bohol was that on which the Spaniards first
established themselves: it has an excellent Harbour formed by that of
Mactan, a small Island chiefly famous for the Death of Magellan. Zebu
was greatly injured by the removal of the Seat of Government to Manila.
However it has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>still many Inhabitants particularly Sangleys some
whereof are worth 20,000 Dollars. there are many Houses &amp; Convents
of Stone: The Number of Inhabitants on the Island is about 25, or
30,000. The Productions of this Island are Borona a small Grain like
Millet which is the chief food of the Common People as rice is scarce,
Tobacco Abacca &amp; Cotton of which two they make Cloth; It also
produces the Best Cacao &amp; some Gold &amp; the Mountains yield some
wax &amp; Civet.</p>

Bissayas to the Number of 20,000 &amp; the inland by many Negros who
are hitherto unsubdued &amp; Are very savage.</p>
<p>The Next Island to be mentioned is Pany: Not without reason held the
most populous &amp; fruitful of the Philippins: It is divided into two
Alcaldeas Capis which contains 40,000 People &amp; Ylo Ylo which has
100,000. It is not only the Granary of Samboango &amp;c<sup>a</sup>.
but sends considerable Supplies to Manila; There are also about 10,000
independant Savages in the Mountains. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>This Island besides very great Quantities of Rice, [has] very fine
wheat; Plenty of Wax, oil, Abacca; Dammer &amp; several kinds of Cloth
of which their women manufacture some very fine: The People are strong,
corpulent &amp; fit for any kind of Labor<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e770" title="Not in source">.</span> They are much inclined to
hunting the wild Hogs &amp; Deer which are plenty as well as Tame
Cattle<span class="corr" id="xd27e773" title="Not in source">.</span>
The E. Coast has many excellent Harbours but the W. is destitute of
Shelter for Shipping the whole Island abounds so much in Rivers that
there is nowhere a league of Coast without one &amp; to this [is] owing
the extraordinary fertility of the Country.</p>
<p>The Island Mindoro is high double Land with rugged Mountains covered
with wood &amp; abounding with various kinds of Palms as Buru, Yonote,
or Gumatty of which they make Sago &amp;c<sup>a</sup>. &amp; in all
Country Fruits: In some Places Rice is very plenty as well as Cowrees
but the People are the most indolent of the Philippins; The Mountains
which yields much wax is inhabited by various tribes of independant
Savages. There is one Jurisdiction on the Island the Corregidor whereof
resides at Baco:&mdash;The Island Marinduque is under this Jurisdiction
&amp; yields Dammer wax &amp; Rice: it is remarkable for an excellent
Harbour capable of admitting the largest Ships &amp; sheltered from all
winds. The Inhabitants in this Jurisdiction are about 20,000.</p>
<p>The Spanish Dominion on Magend&#257;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e783src" href="#xd27e783" name="xd27e783src">7</a> comprehends the
whole Coasts from Samboangan by the North to Carayas. In General it
yields much Gold, particularly Butuan, wax, Cinnamon, Civet, good
Cacao, Cotton, Sago, Rice, &amp; Pepper thrives very well, they have
many fine woods Brazil Ebony &amp;c<sup>a</sup>. &amp; the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>Country
also yields Sulphur &amp; Salt Petr&eacute;. It is not indeed without
Reason this is held the richest of the Philippins &amp; from its many
Lakes &amp; Rivers extremely convenient for inland Commerce. The
Natives are very numerous inland &amp; besides those under the Spanish
Yoke may be divided into three Denominations&mdash;The Subanos or
Nation of the Rivers who are Gentiles &amp; very numerous. The Illanon
who are under many petty Princes situated around the Lake of Mallanao
&amp; the Magindaos: the two last being Mahometans &amp; at war with
the Spaniards. The Natives under the Spanish Dominion are few in Number
compared with the others &amp; we omit their Number to make up any
Deficiency in the other Jurisdiction.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e793src" href="#xd27e793" name="xd27e793src">8</a></p>
<p>Amongst the smaller Islands which remain unmentioned Masbate is the
Chief: it yields wine Civet, some amber &amp; when the Spaniards first
settled much Gold. The others are not remarkable for their Productions
except Polo which yields much Gold &amp; Ligu [<i>i.e.</i>, Ligao?]
Alloes Lampon opposite to this Island has been proposed for landing the
Treasure from Acapulco in war for which it is extremely convenient
being only 36 hours Journey to Manila.</p>
<p>It may appear wonderful that so many Islands so excellent in
Situation should yield so little for foreign Commerce except Provisions
however that is not to be ascribed to the Barre&ntilde;ess of the
Country but solely to the Indolence &amp; Bad Government of the
Spaniards&mdash;However it is past doubt that were there a more
equitable Jurisdiction established, that the Benefit attending the
Possession of these Islands would be very considerable to be convinced
of this it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=

of People they contain:</p>

<p>From which making a deduction of <i>20,000</i> for the Captives made
by the Moors the Number of Indians in these Islands, exclusive of
Luzon, under the Spanish Dominion must exceed 330,000. The Value of
such an acquisition we presume is too evident to need Discussion.</p>
<p>We are now to consider the Practicability of the Conquest.</p>
<p>There are several Forts of Stone on the Southern Islands besides
Stockades<span class="corr" id="xd27e887" title=
"Not in source">.</span> But as all these were originally intended
against the Moorish Incursions they are not formidable to a European
Power if we may be allowed to form a Judgem<sup>t</sup> from those
esteemed by the Spaniards the strongest viz. Samboangan &amp; Ylo Ylo.
of which two we have had an opportunity to form some Idea from Personal
Observation.</p>
<p>Samboangan Fort &amp; Town mount 65 Guns<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e895" title="Not in source">.</span> But as the Fort is upon the
Shoar &amp; deep water close to it the reduction is a matter of few
hours the Garrison when Compleat <abbr title=
"about">ab<sup>t</sup>.</abbr> 2 or 300 Guushinanzas but at present
very few as we have been assured.</p>
<p>Ylo Ylo is of Stone cracked in several Places it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>mounts
about 50 guns some 18 &amp; 24 pounders &amp; 3 Mortars &amp; had in
the End of 1761 a Garrison of 46 Guerchinanyas &amp; 34 Pampanga
Soldiers this is the only Fort on Pany &amp; is within Pistol Shot of
Shipping but of difficult access &amp; indeed I do not conceive in the
S. W. winds that it would be practicable to go thither with large Ships
It has no Ditch or Glacis.</p>
<p>Such being the Condition of the two Principal Let us pass [to] a
Description of the others but as they occur in the Expedition
proposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that a Europe Ship shall sail for Sooloo in Company
with one or more smaller Vessells equipped for war with a Detachment of
<abbr title="about">ab<sup>t</sup>.</abbr> 50 Europeans &amp; some
Seapoys for Sooloo the Europe Ship to take in the Cargo there for China
&amp; to proceed for Samboangan the reduction of which Fort we consider
as a Matter of Course. The only Use of Samboangan is to prevent the
Incursions of the Moors by the Strait of Basilan But this is a Point of
no Consequence as it only makes them pass on the S. Side of Basilan it
is therefore proposed to dismantle Samboangan or to leave it with the
present Spanish Garrison provided they will take the Oath of allegiance
till a General Peace settles the Fate of the Philipinas &amp; in that
Case to leave them only a Quantity of Ammunition sufficient for
occasional Defence.</p>
<p>It is then proposed to proceed to Missamis where a small Stone Fort
built lately to command the Pass of Panguel Lake This Place is a
Station of the utmost Consequence as the Possession of it opens a
Communication with the Illanon with whom by the mediation of Sooloo the
Confederacy must be made. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>The Possession of Missamis will be
supported by a Garrison of 25 Europeans &amp; a Guard Ship for which
Service a Ship built for a Man of War there may be used &amp; it mand
with a Detachment of 30 Men from the Europe Ship whose Place may be
supplied with transports or Guachinanyas from Samboangan It is proposed
to make a Declaration at taking Samboangan that in Case the Islands do
not submit they must stand the Consequence of the Moorish Incursions
&amp; a Confederacy with the Moors may be made to aid them in infesting
the Spanish Districts by supplying them with Ammunition<span class=
"corr" id="xd27e922" title="Not in source">.</span> The General Terror
of the Moors will influence as well the Indians as the Padres to submit
when they find that this only can protect them from in truth the
greatest of all Calamitys.</p>
<p>It is proposed the Ships shall proceed from Missamis to Zebu the
reduction of which City will be a matter of equal Facility &amp;
Importance as the Fort is very inconsiderable close to the Sea without
Ditch &amp; the Garrison according to the Spanish writers a Compy of
100 Guichenangas &amp; another of Pampangas &amp; Cagayans tho it
appears that it is now even more inconsiderable. Adjoining to Zebu is
Bohol now in rebellion &amp; said to be apostatized certainly they have
murderd &amp; ejected at least some of the Fathers they are considered
as of the same Original as the Sooloos &amp; are held the Bravest of
the Philipinas<span class="corr" id="xd27e927" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Such Circumstances evince not only the
Facility of a Confederacy with them but of the Consequence of this in
making a Divission against the Spaniards &amp; protecting the Conquerd
Islands to which it may not be improper to observe that some time ago
the Boholons offerd if the King of Spain <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>would remit the Tribute
that they would protect at their own Charge all the Bissayas which
Proposal was however neglected.</p>
<p>There is a Ship at Sooloo which may have good Consequences we mean
redeeming with Captives as may be found useful as Guides in the
different districts of the Bissayas.</p>
<p>The reduction of Zebu should terminate the action of the Europe Ship
which should then proceed to China with her Cargo &amp; on her return
call at Manila to Convey the Sultan if he can not be sent
sooner<span class="corr" id="xd27e937" title="Not in source">.</span>
The operation of the other Vessells should be directed towards the
reduction of Leyte &amp; Samar which are destitute of Forts &amp; which
are solely under the Jurisdiction of the Jesuits.</p>
<p>The N. E. Monsoon is the most convenient time for the attack of Ylo
Ylo unless a Detachment could be made from Magendanao<span class="corr"
id="xd27e942" title="Not in source">.</span> The reduction of Pany is
an important Object in two Lights as a Granary to the Bissayas in
general &amp; therefore a Security for their Submission &amp; as a
Place from whence all our Possessions &amp; even Manila itself may have
resource. However the Junction of Bohol &amp; the Moors seem to require
the Zebu Rout.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p>It is with the greatest pleasure I have the honour to acquaint their
Lordships with the success of his Majesty&rsquo;s arms, in the
reduction of the city of Manila, which was taken by storm on the
morning of the 6th instant.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e977src" href=
"#xd27e977" name="xd27e977src">2</a> In my letters of the 23d and 31st
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>of July, I acquainted their Lordships with my
proceedings to that time; after which I used every possible means at
Madrass for dispatch, the decline of the S. W. monsoon making it of the
utmost importance. To promote this end, I completed the Elisabeth,
Grafton, Lenox, Weymouth, and Argo, with such of the troops and
military stores as they were to take on board, and on the 29th sent
them away under the command of Commodore Tiddeman, to proceed to
Malacca, with a view that they might complete their water there by the
time I should arrive with the remainder of the squadron.</p>
<p>Having accomplished the imbarkation of everything designed for the
expedition, with a dispatch much beyond my expectation, as we had from
the whole time of my being there a violent surf to contend with, I
sailed the 1st of August with the ships under mentioned, <i>viz.</i>
Norfolk, Panther, America, Seaford, South-sea castle storeship, Admiral
Stevens storeship, Osterly company&rsquo;s ship, leaving the Falmouth,
at the request of the president and council, to convoy the Essex India
ship, who was not ready to sail, having the treasure to take on board
for the China cargoes, and to bring to Manila such of the
company&rsquo;s servants as were to be put in possession of that
government, if the expedition succeeded.</p>
<p>The 19th, I arrived at Malacca, and was disappointed in not finding
Mr. Tiddeman there; who did not join till the 21st, having met with
long calms. The difficulty of watering the squadron at this place made
it the 27th before I could leave the road.</p>
<p>On the 2d of September, I arrived off Pulo Timean, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>and was
joined by Capt. Grant in the Seahorse, whom I had detached, upon my
first arrival at Madrass, to cruise between this island and the
streights of Singapore, to stop any vessels he might suspect going to
Manila.</p>
<p>On the 19th, I made the coast of Luconia; but was drove off again by
a strong N. E. wind, which separated some of the squadron. The 22d, the
gale broke up, and the wind shifting to the S. W. the 23d we recovered
the land again. The next day [we] entered the bay of Manila, and, in
the close of the evening, anchored off the fort of Cavite, with the
whole squadron, except the South-sea castle and Admiral Stevens, the
Falmouth and Essex having joined me off the coast. In the night I sent
the masters to sound about the fortifications of Cavite; and, by their
report, found that it might be attacked by ships.</p>
<p>The 25th in the morning, the wind not being favourable to attack the
Cavite, I took two of the frigates, and with Gen. Draper,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e999src" href="#xd27e999" name="xd27e999src">3</a>
and some other officers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=
"#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>reconnoitred the shore about Manila,
and observed some churches and other buildings to stand near the works
on the south side of the town, particularly toward the S. W. bastion.
We had some design of attacking Cavite first, to have had the
conveniency of that port for the shipping; but considered, that though
the attack should be attended with all the success we could hope, yet
it would cause a delay at least of two days before we could land at
Manila, which time would afford opportunity to the enemy to demolish
these buildings near their works, and to prepare many obstacles to our
landing, and perhaps recover from that consternation our unexpected
arrival had thrown them in; and farther, Manila being the Capital, if
that fell, Cavite would in consequence.</p>
<p>From those considerations, I joined in opinion with the General to
take advantage of circumstances so favorable for a descent, and land
the troops with all dispatch, and endeavour to get possession of some
posts near their works, which, if effected, would greatly facilitate
the reduction of the city.</p>
<p>In consequence of these resolutions, I immediately made the signal
on board the Seahorse for the squadron to join me, and for the troops
to prepare to land. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>About seven in the evening, the 79th
regiment, with the marines, in the boats, under the direction of the
Capt<sup>n</sup> Parker, Kempenfelt, and Brereton, pushed for the
shore; and under the fire of the three frigates, effected the landing
at a church called the <i>Moratta</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, Malate], about a
mile and a half from the walls.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1033src"
href="#xd27e1033" name="xd27e1033src">4</a> We had no opposition from
the enemy, but some difficulty from the surf, which run high, and
bilged all the long-boats; but happily lost no men.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e1040src" href="#xd27e1040" name="xd27e1040src">5</a></p>
<p>The next morning the General took an advanced post about 200 yards
from the glacis; and there, under cover of a blind, intended his
battery against the face of the south-west bastion. The number of
troops being small, I landed a battalion of seamen, consisting of about
700 men, under the command of the Capt<sup>n</sup> Collins, Pitchford,
and George Ourry.</p>

</div>
<p>The 25th, I dispatched three armed boats after a galley coming up
the bay to Manila. They came up with her, resolutely boarded her, and
took her, notwithstanding she kept up a smart fire with patteraroes and
muskets. She mounted two carriages and seventeen brass swivel guns, and
had eighty men. By <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51"
name="pb51">51</a>]</span>letters, found in her, we discovered she was
dispatched from the galleon St. Philippina [<i>i.e.</i>,
&ldquo;Filipino&rdquo;] from Acapulco, and whom she had left the 10th
of September at Cajayagan,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1072src" href=
"#xd27e1072" name="xd27e1072src">6</a> between the Embocadero and Cape
Spiritu Santa. Upon this discovery I came to a resolution to send the
Panther and Argo<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1077src" href="#xd27e1077"
name="xd27e1077src">7</a> in quest of her; but it was the 4th of
October before the weather permitted their sailing.</p>
<p>The 28th of September the General acquainted me that he was
beginning to work on the battery; and that if some ships could get near
enough to throw shot on the works of the town opposed to it, it might
take off some of the enemy&rsquo;s fire and attention, and thereby
facilitate its construction. In consequence of this, I ordered Com.
Tiddeman, with the Elisabeth and Falmouth, towards the town, as near as
the depth of water would permit, and to place the ships in such a
position as would best answer the purpose intended; which was
accordingly done the next day, and their fire had a very good
effect.</p>
<p>On the 30th, the South-sea castle arrived with stores, which were
much wanted, particularly the intrenching tools; for want of which the
army had been so greatly distressed, that I was obliged to employ all
the forges in making spades, pickaxes, &amp;c. for them. The 1st of
October it began to blow fresh, and in the night increased to a hard
gale,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1084src" href="#xd27e1084" name=
"xd27e1084src">8</a> which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>drove the South-sea castle ashore
near the Polverista, a little to the southward of our camp. This
accident however had some considerable advantages attending it, as the
situation she lay in made her cannon a protection for the rear of our
camp: it was likewise the means that all her military stores were got
on shore with safety and dispatch, and the army supplied with the
provisions she had on board, both which were articles they stood in
immediate need of, and which could not have been supplied by boats, as
it continued blowing weather for several days after, and the surf
breaking very high on the beach. This gale was from W. S. W. directly
on the shore, which gave me much concern for the safety of the
squadron, particularly for the Elisabeth and Falmouth, who were only in
four fathom water, and, as I have since been informed, with the sand of
the sea struck; but the bottom being mud, and soft to a considerable
depth, they received no damage. On the 4th in the morning, the General
opened the battery, which was so well managed, and seconded by the
ships before the town, that in four hours the defences were taken off,
and the next day in the evening the breach was made practicable.</p>
<p>On the 6th, at day-light in the morning, the General&rsquo;s
regiment, with the sea-battalion, mounted the breach, made the attack,
and soon got possession of all the bastions, which completed the
conquest. I immediately went on shore, and, with the General, had a
meeting with the Spanish governor, and some of his principal officers;
when a capitulation was agreed on, that the town and port of Cavite,
with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>islands and forts dependent on Manila, should be
given up to his Brittanic Majesty, and that they should pay four
millions of dollars for the preservation of the town and their effects,
(a copy of which capitulation I have inclosed).</p>
<p>On the 10th, I sent Capt. Kempenfelt<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1097src" href="#xd27e1097" name="xd27e1097src">9</a> in the
Norfolk, with the Seaford and Seahorse, to take possession of Cavite,
agreeable to the capitulation. By this acquisition we are in possession
of a very large quantity of naval stores; and beside the advantage of
almost every convenience for refitting a squadron, the people are
supplied with fresh meat and vegetables in a great plenty.</p>
<p>The siege, though short, was attended with many difficulties, and
great fatigue, in which both the officers and men exerted themselves
with the utmost chearfulness. We had constantly fresh gales, a lee
shore, and consequently a high surf, to contend with, which made it
always difficult, frequently hazardous, and sometimes impossible, to
land with boats. The rains fell very heavy, and our little army were
surrounded and harassed by numerous bodies of Indians, who, though
undisciplined, and armed only with lances, bows and arrows, yet by a
daring resolution, and contempt for death, they became not only
troublesome, but formidable. I have the satisfaction of acquainting
their Lordships, that throughout the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>whole expedition, the
most perfect harmony and unanimity has subsisted between his
Majesty&rsquo;s land and sea forces.</p>
<p>You will receive with this, an account of the number of officers and
men, both seamen and marines, that were landed from the squadron, as
likewise of the killed and wounded in each corps. It is with concern I
acquaint their Lordships with the loss of Commodore Tiddeman, who in
attempting to enter the river in his barge, the morning after the
reduction of Manila, was drowned with five of his people, by which
unhappy accident his Majesty has lost a brave and experienced
officer.</p>
<p>Capt. Kempenfelt, by whom I send this (and [who] will present to you
for their Lordships a plan of the town of Manila, and the port of
Cavite) has been of the greatest assistance to me during the course of
this enterprise. He is very capable of furnishing their Lordships with
many particulars necessary for their information; and his great merit
makes it my duty to recommend him as a very able officer.<a class=

Clevland, dated in the bay of Manila, the 10th of November,
1762.</i></h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In my letter of the 31st of October, I acquainted you
of my having sent Capt. Parker, with the Panther and Argo, in quest of
the galleon Saint Philipina, from Acapulco bound to Manila.</p>
<p>The 7th instant, Capt. King in the Argo, returned, with a letter
from Capt. Parker, acquainting me, that in consequence of my orders,
having the 30th of October, got the length of the island Capul, near
the entrance into the Embocadero, in pursuit of the Saint Philipina,
where the Argo had come to an anchor (and which he intended to do for
that night), just as the day closed saw a sail, and stand to the
northward; at eight in the evening he got sight of the chace, about two
leagues to leeward, but unluckily, by the rapidity of a counter current
to what the chace was in, was drove among the Narango&rsquo;s,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1239src" href="#xd27e1239" name=
"xd27e1239src">11</a> in the utmost danger of being lost, and obliged
to anchor: the frigate having escaped the danger, got up with the
chace, and engaged her near two hour; but was so roughly handled, that
Capt. King was obliged to bring too to repair his damage. By this time
the current slackened, which enabled Capt. Parker to get under sail
with the chace in sight. About nine the next morning he came up with
her, and after battering her two hours within half-musket shot, she
struck. The enemy made but little resistance, trusting to the immense
thickness of the sides of their ship, which the Panther&rsquo;s shot
was not able to penetrate, excepting <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>her upper works. Capt.
Parker was no less disappointed than surprised, when the General came
on board, to find, that instead of the Saint Philipina, he had engaged
and taken the Santissimo Trinidad,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1246src"
href="#xd27e1246" name="xd27e1246src">12</a> who departed from Manila
the 1st of August for Acapulco, and had got 300 leagues to the eastward
of the Embocadero; but meeting with a hard gale of wind, was dismasted
and put back to refit. She had 800 men on board, and pierced for sixty
guns, but when Capt. King engaged her, had only six mounted, and but
thirteen when taken. She draws thirty-three feet of water, and is a
much larger ship <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>than the Panther. I cannot ascertain the value of
her cargo, but there is to the amount of one million and a half of
dollars registered, and she is reputed to be worth three millions.</p>
<p>Capt. King left the Panther with her prize at an anchor about three
leagues south of the Corregidow [<i>i.e.</i>, Corregidor], at the mouth
of this bay; and as I have sent a reinforcement of men with launches
and warps, I hope very soon to have them in safety.<a class="noteref"

regarding Samuel Cornish are few. In 1743, when captain of the
fifty-gun ship &ldquo;Guernsey,&rdquo; he destroyed a Spanish privateer
of twenty-two guns, which had taken shelter under an eight-gun battery
near Cape de Gatt. He also performed numerous other services of the
same kind, and took and destroyed a fleet of zebecks laden with
provisions. In 1756 he was captain of the &ldquo;Stirling
Castle,&rdquo; a vessel carrying 480 men, most of them the refuse of
jails and the scum of the streets. In 1759 he was sent with
re&euml;nforcements to the East Indies, in the &ldquo;Lenox,&rdquo;
Captain Robert Jocelyn commanding, where he was re&euml;nforced in 1760
with five ships. He was at the reduction of Pondicherry in 1760, and at
the reduction of Mahe in 1761. Thence he went to Bombay to refit, and
went to meet Commodore Keppel for the attack of Bourbon and Mauritius,
although these orders were later changed. His promotions are as
follows: captain, 1742; rear admiral (white), 1759, (red), 1761; rear
admiral (blue), 1762, (red), 1770. He was made a baronet in 1766. His
death occurred October 30, 1770. See Allen&rsquo;s <i>Battles of
British navy</i> (London, 1878), i, pp. 147, 148; Clowes&rsquo;s

with Spain came partly as a consequence of the so-called &ldquo;Family

Versailles, August 25, 1761. England declared war against Spain,

Draper was the son of a collector of customs of Bristol, where he was
born in 1721. He received his education at Eton and King&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge. Entering the military service, he went to the East
Indies, where he entered the services of the East India Company,
attaining the rank of colonel in 1760. In 1761 he was promoted to the
rank of brigadier-general for the expedition to Belle Isle. When in
Canton, China, whither he went for his health after the defense of
Madras in 1759, he took occasion to study conditions in the
Philippines, and learned that the Spaniards had no fear of attack since
they were so far from Europe. He communicated plans to Lord Anson and
Lord Egremont for their conquest at the first rumors of war with Spain,
and was ordered to outline his plan fully. The colors taken at the
storming of Manila were given by him to King&rsquo;s College, where
they were hung in the chapel. When the 79th regiment was reduced he was
given command of the 16th regiment of foot, but resigned that post. His
health rendered it necessary for him to retire to South Carolina, in
1769, and while in America he made a tour of the colonies. In 1769 he
married the daughter of Chief-Justice Lancey of New York, by whom he
had one daughter. He had reached the rank of lieutenant-general in 1779
when he was appointed governor-general of Minorca, which office he held
until the surrender of that island. His death occurred January 8, 1787,
while in retirement at Bath. See <i>New and general biographical

driven the enemy back, for they disembarked on a day when the waves
were high and when there was a heavy surf, which overturned a lancha
carrying a cannon of the caliber of eighteen. All its men fell into the
water, and its equipment was rendered almost useless. Their men left
the other lanchas with the water up to their breasts carrying their
muskets and cartridge-boxes on their heads. Amid this discomfort, two
hundred men reached the beach. They immediately formed ranks and
allowed the others to disembark more quietly. See Martinez de

George Anson was descended from a family long established in
Staffordshire, and was born at Shugborough manor, in the parish of
Colwich, April 23, 1697. Choosing the sea as his career, he became
second lieutenant May 9, 1716. In 1718 he took part in the action near
Sicily in which the Spanish fleet was destroyed. The years
1724&ndash;27 he spent in a naval position in South Carolina, erecting
there the town Anson Bourgh, and giving name to a county. He made two
other trips to South Carolina, where he had acquired considerable
property. On the outbreak of hostilities with Spain in 1739, he was
chosen commander of the fleet to attack the Pacific Spanish-American
settlements, and while engaged in this mission made his celebrated
circumnavigation of the world, capturing the Philippine galleon on June
20, 1743. He arrived at England, June 15, 1744, after many dangers, in
which he displayed great hardihood and courage. Shortly after his
return, he was made a rear-admiral of the blue, and soon after that was
elected to Parliament. December 27, 1744, he was appointed one of the
commissioners of the admiralty, and April 23, 1745 was made a
rear-admiral of the white. July 14, 1746 he was appointed vice admiral,
and during that and the succeeding year performed many services for his
country. June 13, 1747, he was appointed to the peerage. Most of the
rest of his life was passed as a member of the admiralty board, he
finally becoming its head, having attained the rank of admiral. He died
June 6, 1762, so that the letter written by Cornish never reached him,
being written indeed some months after that event. See <i>New and

Gentil (<i lang="fr">Voyage</i>, Paris, 1781, ii, pp. 247, 248), says
of these Frenchmen: &ldquo;The English, on arriving at Manila, had with
them about three hundred and fifty Frenchmen, enrolled by force. These
people formed a plan to desert them at the first opportunity. The
English had not yet finished their battery, when the little French
troop sent two trusty men to confer with the place and to agree with
them for a sortie, during which the French troop would take the side of
the Spaniards. Two men were sacrificed; they went without weapons,
their arms crossed, to present themselves at the gate of the city.
Instead of opening it to them, they were allowed to be massacred by the
Indians who did not know them. At Manila, innumerable chimerical ideas
have been formed as to the sudden arrival of these two men. But what
can two men who come without weapons and with crossed arms to present
themselves at the gate of a city do? What is there to fear from them to
refuse to receive them? I believe that they were taken for English at
Manila, and that a poorly understood religious motive was the reason
for the very great fault of not opening the gate to them. Whatever it
was, this treatment did not engage others to sacrifice themselves. But
the English, having some doubt of some resolution on the part of the
French, put it out of their power to attempt anything to their
prejudice, by placing them between the Sepoys and their national
troops, with orders to fire on these French, if they were seen to
comport themselves differently than the others.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class=

Magazine</i> for 1763, xxv, p. 235, contains the following in regard to
these plates: &ldquo;They write from London, of April 21, thus.
&lsquo;There were found at the Manilas, among many other curiosities,
and brought here by Col. Draper, eight copper-plates, on which are
engraved a most particular map of the Philippine islands, adorned with
the customs and habits of the inhabitants of those parts, which was
done by order of the governor, in 1734, and dedicated to his Catholic
Majesty.&rsquo;&mdash;By an advertisement since inserted in the papers,
some few impressions are proposed to be taken of these original
copper-plates.&rdquo; What is probably one of these impressions was
sold recently by the firm of Henry Stevens, Son and Stiles, London, to
the Library of Congress. This is the celebrated Murillo Velarde map.
The map is printed in four sheets, as are also the pictures (three to a
sheet) of the &ldquo;customs and habits of the inhabitants,&rdquo; and
are so arranged that the map is in the middle with the pictures grouped
on its right and left sides. The map as sold by the above firm was
arranged in two large sheets, with a margin left so that the sheets
could be easily joined. The whole map if pasted on one single sheet
with the pictures would measure about 1170 mm. wide, and
1082&ndash;1087 mm. high. The difference in height between the two
halves seems to be due to the lines not being drawn quite true on the
plates, although shrinkage of paper may affect it slightly. This map is
described by Pardo de Tavera in his <i lang="es">El mapa de Filipinas
del P. Murillo Velarde</i> (Manila, 1894); and <i lang="fr">La carte
des Philippines du Pere Murillo Velarde</i> (Paris, 1898), the latter
being a separate or &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Extrait du Bulletin de
geographie</span>,&rdquo; No. 1, 1897. Marcel reproduces several of the
pictures. The map contained in the Ayer Murillo Velarde is
unaccompanied by the pictures, and was engraved in 1744. We are
indebted for much of this note to the courtesy of the above-named
firm.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd27e1391src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p>[The following letter, dated one day later than the above, appears

letter.]</p>
<p><i>Whitehall, April 16. 1763.</i> On Thursday night, Lt-Col. Scott
arrived with the following letter to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>Earl of Egremont, from
Brig-Gen. Draper, who also arrived himself about the same time.</p>
<p class="dateline"><i>Manila, Nov. 2, 1762.</i></p>
<p class="salute">My Lord,</p>
<p>I do myself the honour of sending Lt-Col Scott, late
adjutant-general, to inform your Lordship of the success of his
Majesty&rsquo;s arms in the conquest of Manila, the surrender of the
port of Cavite, and the cession of the Philippine islands.</p>
<p>On the 6th of October we took the capital by storm, after twelve
days operation, which are detailed in my journal. Our loss upon this
occasion would have been trifling, but for the death of Maj. More, a
valiant good officer; and it is with particular satisfaction I can
assure your Lordship, that the firm bravery and perseverance of the
troops could only be equalled by their humanity after victory. Out of
respect and deference to Adm. Cornish, we waited till he came on shore;
and, being desirous to save so fine a city from destruction, we jointly
dictated the annexed conditions to the Governor-General (the
Archbishop), and the chief magistrates; who most readily embraced
them.</p>
<p>Considering their critical situation, and vast opulence, the terms
were as reasonable for them as beneficial to us. We allow the India
company a third part of the ransom, the whole of which amounts to a
million Sterling;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1778src" href="#xd27e1778"
name="xd27e1778src">3</a> and, according to my instructions,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>I have this day delivered up Manila, one of the
richest cities and islands in this part of the world, with the port of
Cavite, to Dawson Drake, Esq; and the other gentlemen appointed to
receive them on behalf of the company, with all the artillery,
ammunition, and warlike stores found therein, agreeable to the inclosed
inventories. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>I have appointed Maj. Fell of the 79th regiment to be commandant of
the garrison; which must consist of all the troops brought from
Madrass, as the great extent of the place, its very numerous
inhabitants, and unsettled country, with the importance of the Cavite,
demand at least this force for an effectual security.</p>
<p>The season of the year, and condition of the squadron, oblige us to
defer the taking possession of the subordinate places ceded to the
crown, until the ships have had a sufficient repair; and I have the
pleasure to acquaint your Lordship, that the large quantity of naval
stores taken in the royal magazines at Cavite, supply most excellent
materials for this purpose, in which the Admiral is indefatigable;
whose zeal for his Majesty&rsquo;s service, great cordiality, and
constant attention to us during the whole course of the expedition, and
fatiguing progress of the siege, are beyond all praise. The other
officers of the fleet exerted themselves to the utmost upon every
occasion. As a small acknowledgment of our many obligations to Mr
Kempenfeldt, the Admiral&rsquo;s Captain, I begged his acceptance of
the government of the citadel and port of Cavite, till it was given up
to the company. His prudent and excellent regulations there, were of
the greatest utility to the public service.</p>
<p>The Captains Collins, Pitchford, and George Ourry, who commanded the
battalion of seamen, behaved with great spirit and conduct; and Capt.
Jocelyn, who was intrusted with the care of the disimbarkations, gave
us all the assistance that could be wished or expected from a diligent
good officer. The marine officers and corps were of great service, and
the seamen astonished us with most extraordinary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>proofs
of activity and valour, particularly those who assisted at our
batteries.</p>
<p>The reduction of Manila has been so much owing to the consummate
skill and bravery of Col. Monson, that I fear my faint representations
cannot do justice to his merits; and I most humbly beg leave, through
your Lordship, to recommend him to his Majesty: together with the
following officers, <i>viz.</i> Lt-Col<span class="corr" id="xd27e1811"
title="Not in source">.</span> Scott; Maj. Barker, who commanded our
artillery; Capt. Fletcher, major of brigade; the Engineers Capt.
Stevenson and Cotsford, and Ens. Barnard; the Captains Moore and
Pemble, aides-de-camp, who have all acted in their several departments
with extraordinary merit, and greatly facilitated my good fortune. Both
the Royal and the Company&rsquo;s Artillery, with their other troops,
behaved very well. In the last place, may I presume to point out the
services of the 79th regiment, which, from the good conduct of their
former and present field officers, has the peculiar merit of having
first stopped the progress of the French in India, and not a little
contributed to the happy turn and decision of that war under Col.
Coote, and has since extended the glory of his Majesty&rsquo;s arms to
the utmost verge of Asia. Twenty-three officers, with upwards of 800
men, have fallen, in the cause of their country, since the regiment
left England: numbers of the survivors are wounded. Your
Lordship&rsquo;s goodness encourages me to mention them as objects of
compassion and protection. Capt. Fletcher has nine colours to lay at
his Majesty&rsquo;s feet.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1814src" href=

the expedition against Manila. They should, he says, have first seized
the posts about Manila, and the city would have fallen of its own
accord because of its weakness, without the necessity of a siege; and
in addition the &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; would not have been able to
escape. Another mistake was made in allowing Anda to form his army.</p>

"xd27e1778" href="#xd27e1778src" name="xd27e1778">3</a></span> A
correspondent writes to the editor of <i>Scots Magazine</i> under date
of June 21, 1767 (see <i>Scots Magazine</i> for 1767, pp. 305, 306) the
following: &ldquo;By an advertisement in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i> of
the 13th instant, notice is given to the officers and soldiers who are
intitled to share in the capture of Manilla, that they will, on the 3d
of July next, be paid their respective shares of the sum of 8053 l. 17
s. 8d. arising from sales of stores taken at Manilla, and other prizes;
&lsquo;one third part of the sum being first deducted, as the
proportion allotted to the East-India company.&rsquo; And as many
disputes have arisen concerning the right of the East-India company to
share in those conquests, permit me to state the matter in its true
light. In the years 1757 and 1758, the East-India company&rsquo;s
principal settlements in that part of the world, were in the utmost
danger of being totally ruined, and their trade destroyed, by the
superior forces of the French; and on a proper representation to
government, a fleet was fitted out at a very considerable national
expence, to save them from the then impending ruin. The forces sent out
in the year 1758 for this purpose, met with the desired success:
Calcutta was retaken; Pondecherry, Vellure, Arney, and several other
principal forts, cities, and garrisons, were taken from the French,
with money, stores, ammunition, and other effects, to the amount of
some millions, which the East-India company, or their servants, took
the entire possession of, and have appropriated to their own use,
though by the laws of conquest, as well as by his Majesty&rsquo;s
gracious declaration, the whole of the booty belongs to those brave
officers, soldiers, and seamen, who were at the reduction of those
important conquests. After the uncommon fatigues and hardships of his
Majesty&rsquo;s troops in the reduction of those places, they were
ordered to the siege of Manilla; which they took by storm: and that
city being afterwards ransomed by the Spaniards for one million
Sterling, <i>this powerful and generous ally, the East-India
company</i>, was modest enough to demand only one-third part of the
entire ransom; and one-fourth part of the said million Sterling being
paid shortly after the conquest, and hostages delivered to his
Majesty&rsquo;s commanders, as sureties for payment of the remainder,
the East-India company were accordingly paid one third part of 250,000
l. and the hostages delivered over to their governor there; but, for
reasons best known to themselves, their governor thought proper to
deliver up the said hostages to the Spaniards, without taking any
further security for the payment of the remainder of the ransom, being
750,000 l. and therefore not one shilling thereof has been since paid.
This, Sir, is the true state of this shameful and scandalous
transaction, which I have no doubt but you will speedily communicate to
the public.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>A journal of the proceedings of his Majesty&rsquo;s
forces on the expedition against Manila</i></p>
<p>The troops allotted for this enterprise were the 79th regiment, and
a company of the Royal Artillery. The auxiliaries furnished by the
gentlemen at Madrass, consisted of thirty of their artillery, six
hundred Seapoys, a company of Caffrees, one of Topazes, and one of
pioneers; to which they added the precarious assistance of two
companies of Frenchmen, inlisted in their service, with some hundreds
of unarmed Lascars for the use of the engineers and park of artillery.
As a compensation for this feeble supply of men, they favoured us with
some very good officers in every branch of the service. Rear Adm.
Cornish reinforced our little army with a fine battalion of five
hundred and fifty seamen and two hundred and seventy good marines. So
that the whole force for the land operations amounted to two thousand
three hundred men; who, with the necessary stores, were imbarked on
board of his Majesty&rsquo;s squadron, and two India ships employed as
transports, with an activity and dispatch that did great honour to all
concerned in those arrangements.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2041src"
href="#xd27e2041" name="xd27e2041src">1</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>The
preparations were commenced, completed, and shipped, in three weeks,
through a raging and perpetual surf, by which some lives were lost.</p>
<p>As Maj.-Gen. Lawrence was of opinion, that the settlements would be
in danger if more forces were drawn from the coast, the two battalions
of the company&rsquo;s troops, all the cavalry, six thousand Seapoys,
with the part of Col. Monson&rsquo;s, and the highlanders, then at
Madrass, were left for their security. The Medway, York, and Chatham,
that were hourly expected, had orders left for them to remain for the
protection of the trade. We sailed, with the Admiral&rsquo;s division,
the first of August. The Seahorse, Capt. Grant, was previously
dispatched through the streights of Malacca to the entrance of the
China sea, to stop all vessels that might be bound to Manila, or sent
from any of our neighbouring settlements to give the Spaniards notice
of the design. Commodore Tyddyman, with the first division of the fleet
and troops under Col. Monson, sailed two days before us, that our
watering might be more speedily completed at Malacca; where we arrived
the nineteenth of August. We there bought up a large quantity of
rattans to make gabions, a good number of which was finished on board
the several ships. The twenty-seventh we sailed for our second
rendezvous, off the island of Timon. The necessary signals and
instructions were then given for landing on the coast of Luconia.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the twenty-third of September we anchored in Manila bay; and soon
found, that our visit was unexpected; the Spaniards were
unprepared<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2065src" href="#xd27e2065" name=
"xd27e2065src">2</a> To increase as much as possible the visible
confusion and consternation of the enemy, we determined to lose no time
in the attack of the port of Cavite, that was at first intended, but
proceed directly to the grand object, judging that our conquest there
would of course occasion and draw after it the fall of Cavite. On the
morning of the twenty-fourth, we sent an ineffectual summons to the
town, and, with the Admiral and other principal officers, examined the
coast, in order to fix upon a proper spot for landing the troops,
artillery, and stores. We found a most convenient place about two miles
to the south of Manila. Accordingly, all the boats were immediately
prepared by the proper signals: and three frigates, the Argo, Capt.
King; Seahorse, Capt. Grant; and Seaford, Capt. Peighin, were sent in
very near the shore to cover the descent. The 79th regiment, the
marines, a detachment of artillery, with three field-pieces, and one
howitzer, fixed in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84"
name="pb84">84</a>]</span>long-boats, assembled in three divisions
under their sterns; the left, commanded by Col. Monson,
quartermaster-general; the centre by me, with Lt-Col. Scott the
adjutant-general; the right by Maj. More, the eldest field officer. As
we had determined to land near a church and village called
<i>Malata</i>, that was opposite our left, the other two divisions,
which had been separated only to amuse and distract the attention of
the enemy, were ordered to join that as soon as possible. About six in
the evening we pushed, with an even front, for the shore, under the
prudent and skilful management of the Captains Parker of the Grafton,
Kempenfelt the Admiral&rsquo;s captain, and Brereton of the Falmouth,
who had the direction of the boats. The frigates kept up a brisk fire
to the right and left of us, to protect our flanks, and disperse the
enemy, who were beginning to assemble in great numbers both horse and
foot, to oppose our descent. This cannonade had the desired effect.
They retired, and left us a clear coast. But a violent surf arose, many
boats were dashed to pieces, our arms and ammunition much damaged;
providentially no lives were lost. We formed upon the beach, marched,
and took possession of the Malata, fixed our outposts, and passed the
whole night under arms. The Spaniards were employed in burning part of
their suburbs.</p>
<p>The twenty-fifth we seized a fort which the Spaniards had abandoned,
named the <i lang="es">Polverista</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2087src" href="#xd27e2087" name="xd27e2087src">3</a> that proved
a most excellent place of arms, for covering <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>the
landing of our stores, and securing our communication with the
squadron. Col. Monson, who was detached with two hundred men to view
the roads and approaches to Manila, occupied the Hermita church, large
and commodious, about nine hundred yards from the city. We made the
priest&rsquo;s house the headquarters; sent orders to Maj. More to
march up with the 79th regiment to secure and maintain this post, which
was of the utmost consequence, both from its strength, and the great
cover it afforded us from the rains that had deluged the country, and
made it impossible to incamp; for we too soon found, that the monsoon
had broke upon us. The surf continued dangerous; the rains increased;
the landing of our artillery and stores became very hazardous; our
remaining troops were put on shore with much peril, and some loss;
Lieut. Hardwick was drowned. But the courage and activity of the seamen
surmounted all obstacles; they got on shore part of the Seapoys, some
provisions, and such stores as were first wanted, and by signals
demanded from the squadron; the officers of which were indefatigable in
giving us all possible assistance; and Capt. Jocelyn, who was intrusted
with the care of the disimbarkation, did every thing that could be
wished or expected from a diligent good officer. We left the marines at
our first post, the Malata, to be near the Polverista, to preserve our
communications, and guard our stores and park of artillery. The men,
from the good conduct and example of their officers, behaved very well,
and were of great use upon all occasions. As the rains had forced us to
seek the protection of the houses that were under the fire of the
bastions, the Spaniards cannonaded our quarters, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>which
were much nearer the walls than the usual rules of war prescribe. They
attempted likewise to burn more of their suburbs, but were prevented by
the great activity and good conduct of Capt. Fletcher, major of
brigade, and Capt<sup>s</sup> Stevenson and Cotsford, the engineers;
who having advanced under cover of the houses to St. Jago&rsquo;s
[<i>i.e.</i>, Santiago] church, near the sea, and within three hundred
yards of the town, reported its importance so sensibly, that we posted
a body of men there, notwithstanding its contiguity to their bastions.
The enemy soon fired upon us; but not with perseverance or effect
enough to dislodge us. We had some few men killed and wounded.</p>
<p>Twenty-sixth. The Admiral sent on shore the battalion of seamen
under the command of the Captains Collins of the Weymouth, Pitchford of
the America, and George Ourry from the Panther. They were cantoned
between the 79th regiment and the marines. The rest of the
company&rsquo;s troops of all sorts were likewise landed, and put under
cover. The Spaniards advanced out of the garrison, under the command of
the Chevalier Fayett,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2106src" href=
"#xd27e2106" name="xd27e2106src">4</a> with four hundred men, and two
field-pieces; and from a church, about two hundred yards to the right
of that we yesterday took possession of, near the sea, begun a
cannonade upon the right flank of our post. Some Seapoys, under Ens.
Carty, who behaved very well, were first sent to skirmish with them,
supported by three piquets of the 79th regiment, and one hundred
seamen, all under the command of Col. Monson, who soon drove
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>the enemy back into the town. In their precipitate
flight, one of the field-pieces was left upon the glacis.</p>
<p>The superior skill and bravery of our people were so evident from
this affair, that it occasioned a second summons to the Governor; but
to no purpose: the answer was much more spirited than their conduct had
been.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2119src" href="#xd27e2119" name=
"xd27e2119src">5</a> Col. Monson had orders to keep possession of this
second church, if he found it tenible: for as we had not men enough, or
dry ground to make regular approaches, we were forced into these
measures, rash as they seem, and contrary to all rules of our
profession, by our critical situation. From the top of this post, which
we called N<sup>o</sup> 2, we had a perfect view of the enemy&rsquo;s
works. The front we were obliged to attack, was defended by the
bastions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>of St. Diego and St. Andrew [<i>i.e.</i>, San
Diego and San Andr&eacute;s], with orillons and retired flanks, a
ravelin which covered the royal gate, a wet ditch, covered way, and
glacis. The bastions were in excellent order, lined with a great number
of fine brass cannon; but their ravelin was not armed, the covered way
out of repair, the glacis by much too low, and the ditch was not
produced round the capital of the bastion of St. Diego, which
determined us to attack it, and make our dispositions
accordingly.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2130src" href="#xd27e2130"
name="xd27e2130src">6</a> The negligence and omission of the enemy to
post <span class="corr" id="xd27e2137" title=
"Source: centries">sentries</span> in the covered way, gave us an
opportunity of sounding the ditch; which perilous enterprise was
effected by a small party of the 79th regiment, under Capt. Fletcher,
who begged leave to undertake it. The Spaniards fired from their
bastion, and killed or wounded three of our people. The depth of the
water was only five feet, the breadth about thirty yards. As the great
extent of this populous city made it impossible to invest it with our
handful of men, two sides were constantly open to the Spaniards, to
introduce supplies of men and provisions, and carry out their effects.
They availed themselves of our weakness. Their own garrison of eight
hundred men of the Royal regiment, under the command of the Marcus of
Villa Mediana, brigadier-general, was augmented by a body of ten
thousand Indians from the province of Pampanga, a fierce and barbarous
people. These disadvantages were not to be remedied, as we could not
take possession of Minondo, Tondo, and La vera Cruz, the posts which
commanded the river, and communication with the country. The
inundations had secured <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=
"#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>their Parian suburb; but no
difficulties could check the ardor of the troops, who labored
incessantly in making fascines and gabions, and preparing everything
for the construction and opening of our batteries. One for small shells
was completed this night, and played upon the bastion of St. Diego. Its
position was behind the church, nearest the sea, called N<sup>o</sup>
1. The officers of the artillery and engineers exerted themselves in a
manner, that nothing but their zeal for the public service could have
inspired.</p>
<p>Twenty-seventh. The Governor sent out a flag of truce, to apologize
for some barbarities committed by the savages lately mentioned, who had
murdered some straggling seamen; and to request, that a nephew of his,
taken in the bay, might be sent on shore. This gentleman had been
dispatched from the Philippina galleon, just arrived on the coast from
Acapulco, with the first advices of the war. Hostilities ceased till
eleven at night, when we recommenced our fire from the mortars,
increased them to four, and placed a six-pounder on our left flank, as
a further security for our post at St. Jago&rsquo;s church. As the
capture of the galleon, and her treasure, might be well esteemed a
national object, Mr. Cornish proposed sending the Panther and Argo from
the squadron to intercept her, which was consented to; and the officers
of the navy very generously agreed to our sharing any prizes that might
be taken in this cruise, as we had before consented to their sharing
with us in any booty that might be taken at land; and the distribution
to be made according to the rules his Majesty has fixed for the
sea-service. The Admiral likewise sent on shore eight twenty-four
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>pounders ship guns, and two eighteen-pounders, for
our battering train; as, to save time, we brought only the
land-carriages and platforms from Madrass.</p>
<p>Twenty-eighth. The Governor&rsquo;s nephew was landed. My secretary,
Lieut. Fryar, was ordered to conduct him into the town with a flag of
truce. In the mean time, a large party of the garrison, intermixed with
Indians, sallied out to attack our second post, N<sup>o</sup> 2. by
which Lieut. Fryar was advancing to the ravelin-gate. The barbarians,
without respecting his character, inhumanly murdered him, mangling his
body in a manner too shocking to mention. In their fury they mortally
wounded the other gentleman, who had endeavoured to save Mr. Fryar. Our
party received their onset with much firmness and bravery, and repulsed
them with some loss on their side. As it was evident that the Indians
alone were guilty of this horrid piece of barbarity, our soldiers
shewed them no mercy.</p>
<p>Twenty-ninth. The Admiral, at my request, ordered the Elizabeth,
Com. Tyddyman, and the Falmouth, Capt. Brereton, to place themselves as
near the town as the depth of water would permit, and second our
operations, by enfilading the front we intended to attack; but the
shallows kept them at too great a distance to answer the purpose
effectually, though their shot struck much confusion and terror into
the inhabitants. We continued our bombardment day and night.</p>
<p>Thirtieth. The engineers traced out Adm. Cornish&rsquo;s battery for
eight twenty-four pounders, on the left of St. Jago&rsquo;s church; but
the violence of the rains retarded our progress; and the absence of two
ships, that had on board a considerable quantity of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>fascines, and many of our working and intrenching
tools, put us to some inconveniences. The Admiral&rsquo;s goodness
supplied these defects: all the smiths and carpenters in the fleet were
employed in making those instruments; and by their industry and
dispatch, we were enabled to proceed. The Elizabeth and Falmouth
persevered in their cannonade upon the town, which was returned from
the enemy&rsquo;s sea-line without any effect.</p>
<p>October first and second. The weather grew so very tempestuous, that
the whole squadron was in danger, and all communication with it
entirely cut off.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2163src" href="#xd27e2163"
name="xd27e2163src">7</a> The violence of the storm forced the
South-sea castle storeship (which was lately arrived) from her anchors,
and drove her on shore: even in this situation the ship was of great
use. Capt. Sherwood enfiladed the whole sea-beach to the southward, and
kept in awe a large body of Indians, who menaced the Polverista, and
our magazines at the Malata. Nothwithstanding the deluge of rain which
accompanied the wind, by the perseverance of the troops and seamen, we
completed the battery for the twenty-four pounders, raised a
mortar-battery for the heavy shells of ten and thirteen inches, made a
good parallel and communication from the church to the gun-battery, and
established a spacious place of arms on the left of it, near the sea.
The roaring of the waves prevented the enemy from hearing the noise of
our workmen in the night. They gave us no interruption, but seemed to
trust entirely to the elements; while <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>the Governor (the
Archbishop) gave out, that an angel from the Lord was gone forth to
destroy us like the host of Sennacherib.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2171src" href="#xd27e2171" name="xd27e2171src">8</a> On the
afternoon of the 2d, the seamen, with wonderful activity, brought up
and mounted all the guns in the battery; which we masked.</p>
<p>Third. The weather became moderate. At day-light the battery was
opened against the left face of the bastion of St. Diego, towards the
saliant angle. One hundred seamen were appointed to assist the corps of
artillery in this service. Our cannon, by the most excellent skill and
management of Maj. Barker, and the officers under him, were served with
such justness, quickness, and dexterity, that the twelve pieces on that
face of the bastion were silenced in a few hours, and the Spaniards
drove from them. We had but two men killed. At night we began a battery
for three guns, on the left of our place of arms, to silence those that
were in barbet upon the orillon of the bastion of St. Andrew, which
annoyed our flank. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93"
name="pb93">93</a>]</span>We maintained a brisk fire of grape and
musketry all the night, to prevent the enemy from repairing their
embrasures and remounting the cannon. The mortars, now augmented to
seven, were kept constantly playing upon the gorge of the bastion, and
the contiguous defences.</p>
<p>Fourth. About three hours before day one thousand of the Indians
attacked the cantonment of the seamen. They were encouraged to this
attempt by the incessant rains in which they flattered themselves our
fire-arms would be useless. Their approach was favoured by a great
number of thick bushes that grew upon the side of a rivulet, which they
passed in the night, and by keeping close, eluded the vigilance of the
patroles. Upon the alarm, Col. Monson and Capt. Fletcher, with the
piquets, were dispatched to the assistance of the seamen, who very
sensibly kept firm in their posts, and were contented to repulse them
till day-break; when a fresh piquet of the 79th regiment appearing upon
the Indians right flank, they fled, were pursued, and dispersed, with
the loss of three hundred men. Had their skill or weapons been equal to
their strength and ferocity, it might have cost us dear. Although armed
chiefly with bows, arrows, and lances, they advanced up to the very
muzzles of our pieces, repeated their assaults, and died like wild
beasts, gnawing the bayonets. This attack cost us some few men; but we
lost a most excellent sea officer, Capt. Porter, lieutenant of the
Norfolk, sincerely and justly lamented by all. We had scarce finished
this affair, when another body of them, with part of the Spanish
garrison, again attacked the church N<sup>o</sup> 2. forced the Seapoys
from their post in it, nearest the town, and took possession
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>of the top, from whence they killed and wounded
several of our people, who were entirely exposed to all their weapons.
Notwithstanding this disadvantageous situation, the European soldiers
maintained their post behind the church with great firmness and
patience, and at last dislodged the enemy, with the assistance of some
field-pieces, and the good conduct of Maj. Fell, field-officer of the
day, Capt. Fletcher, and other brave officers sent to their relief. The
Spaniards left seventy dead behind them, in and about the church. On
our side, Capt. Strahan, of the 79th regiment, a very good officer, was
mortally wounded, and forty private men wounded or killed. This was the
enemy&rsquo;s last effort: all their Indians, excepting one thousand
eight hundred, discouraged by their losses, returned home. Our working
parties and the fire of our batteries, which had been a little
interrupted by these attacks, recommenced with greater spirit than
ever. We found likewise the good effects of giving the enemy no time to
repair their embrasures or carriages in the night. They opened only an
inconsiderable fire from three or four embrasures in the curtain, too
oblique to have much effect: before night those defences were
ruined.</p>

</div>
<p>Fifth. Maj. Barker&rsquo;s fire was so violent, that the breach
appeared practicable. Our cannon from the three-gun battery silenced
those of the enemy on the orillon of St. Andrew. We were in hopes that
the Spaniards would be sensible of their danger, and think of giving up
the town. But they were obstinate, without bravery, or any generous
resolution of defending the breach. In the evening, the design of
storming the place was communicated to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>principal officers of each department only, and
the necessary preparations made.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2202src"
href="#xd27e2202" name="xd27e2202src">9</a></p>
<p>Sixth. At four o&rsquo;clock in the morning we filed off from our
quarters, in small bodies, to give the less suspicion; and, by degrees,
assembled at St. Jago&rsquo;s church; observing the utmost silence, and
concealing ourselves in the place of arms, and the parallel between the
church and the battery. Maj. Barker kept up a brisk fire upon the
works, and those places where the enemy might be lodged or intrenched.
Our mortars were well applied for the same purpose. At day-break we
discerned a large body of Spaniards formed on the bastion of St.
Andrew, which gave us reason to imagine they had got some information
of our design, and intended to annoy us with their musquetry and grape
from the retired flank of that bastion, where they had still two cannon
placed: but upon the explosion of some shells that fell among them,
they went off. We took immediate advantage of this, and by the signal
of a general discharge of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href=
"#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>our artillery and mortars, rushed on
to the assault, under cover of a thick smoke that blew directly upon
the town. Sixty volunteers of different corps, under Lieut. Russel of
the 79th, led the way, supported by the grenadiers of that regiment:
the engineers, with the pioneers, and other workmen, to clear and
enlarge the breach, and make lodgments, in case the enemy should have
been too strongly intrenched in the gorge of the bastion, followed:
Col. Monson and Maj. More were at the head of two grand divisions of
the 79th: the battalion of seamen advanced next, sustained by the other
two divisions of the 79th: the company&rsquo;s troops closed the rear.
They all mounted the breach with amazing spirit and rapidity. The few
Spaniards upon the bastion dispersed so suddenly, that it was thought
they depended upon their mines. Capt. Stevenson had orders to make a
strict search to discover them; but our precautions were needless. We
met with little resistance, except at the Royal gate, and from the
galleries of the lofty houses which surround the grand square. In the
guard-house over the Royal gate one hundred of the Spaniards and
Indians, who would not surrender, were put to the sword.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2225src" href="#xd27e2225" name=
"xd27e2225src">10</a> Three hundred more, according to the

good posture of defence.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2239src" href=
"#xd27e2239" name="xd27e2239src">12</a> Capt. Dupont of the 79th, with
one hundred men, took possession of it. The Marquis of Villa Mediana,
with the rest of the Spanish officers, were admitted as prisoners of
war on their paroles of honour; and to conciliate the affections of the
natives, all the Indians who fell into our hands were dismissed in
safety. Our joy, upon this fortunate event, was greatly clouded by the
loss of Maj. More, who was transfixed with an arrow near the Royal
gate,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2246src" href="#xd27e2246" name=
"xd27e2246src">13</a> and died immediately, universally lamented for
his good qualities, Capt. Sleigh of the grenadiers, and some other good
officers, were wounded. We had about thirty private men killed or
wounded. In consequence of the terms dictated to the Spaniards, the
port of Cavite and citadel, with several large ships, and a vast
quantity of warlike and naval stores, were surrendered to us. Capt.
Champion, with 100 marines, and as many Seapoys, imbarked on board the
Seahorse to take possession of it. The Spanish garrison of 300 men, on
the approach of our people, mutinied against their officers, plundered
some houses, and went off into the country with their arms.</p>

had received from Capt. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href=

being prepared there for the capture of Manila. A certain secular
priest had a letter which contained the same news; while Father
Cuadrado, <abbr title="Ordo sancti Augustini">O.S.A.</abbr>, received
another letter which mentioned the declaration of war between England
and Spain. On September 14, word was received in Manila from the
outposts on the island of Corregidor of the appearance of a vessel
there the preceding day. A small boat sent ashore from this vessel
inquired how many vessels were in the bay, and whether the
&ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; had entered. This vessel left on the 17th
without any salute. This produced no other sensation in Manila than
some slight suspicions, and no preparations were taken. Word was,
however, despatched to the &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; to make some other
port than at Manila. See Le Gentil&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Voyage</i>, ii,

twenty-sixth, English date) because of the English summons for
surrender, was attended by the following, under the presidency of the
archbishop: Auditors Villacorta, Galb&aacute;n, and Anda; the fiscal

condition to continue its defense, as no especial harm had been seen to
have been done by the enemy, notwithstanding the continual and lively
firing from the 23d when the siege commenced until the present,
therefore they are unanimous and in harmony in their opinion that this
place should be defended until the last extremity; and the enemy should
be informed to the effect that the Spanish arms did not surrender to
any power, for they alone venerated their sovereign, whose royal
sovereignty never deserted his faithful vassals, not even in the most
remote part of this dominion, as were these islands, in which the love
and loyalty of their inhabitants was great, and obliged them to the
defense of this place.&rdquo; See Montero y Vidal, ii, pp. 16,

<p class="first"><i>Journal of what occurred at the attack and defense
of the city of Manila, the capital of Philipinas islands, and of the
archipelago of San Lazaro, from September 22 to October 5, 1762, the
day on which it was taken by assault by Brigadier Guillermo Drapert,
commander-in-chief of the British troops of the East Indias.</i></p>
<p>Before commencing this journal, it is fitting to give a brief
description of the location of Manila, and of the destitute condition
in which the enemy found its fortifications and defenses in order that
we may present a clear idea of the vigorous resistance that was made
even to the last extremity.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2533src" href=
"#xd27e2533" name="xd27e2533src">1</a></p>
<p>The city of Manila, according to the map of Father Murillo, is
located in 14&deg; 40&prime; of north latitude, and 158&deg; 35&prime;
east longitude, on a tongue of land which terminates in a point, and
forming the figure of a jug or flagon, whose extremity or neck is
formed by the above point itself and contains the royal fort of
Santiago. At the west it is terminated by a large bay at the north by
the Pasig River, which bathes its walls. On the land side from south to
east, it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>defended by four flat bastions with their
casemates, and right flanks covered with orillons, and with ditches,
covered way, and glacis. Along the sea, the city is fortified by a long
curtain with five little flat bastions, a reduct located at a great
distance from the wall. The lines of defense have such disproportion
from one another, that those bastions cannot be defended reciprocally.
It is impossible, further, to prevent the approach by the curtain,
because there is neither ditch nor terreplein. Then too, the parapets
are only one foot wide, and the curtain six.</p>
<p>The curtain embracing the north side, bathed by the river, and which
has a kind of curvature where it forms two re&euml;ntrant angles, is in
the same condition of weakness as that of the sea, and is defended by
two small bastions, which present the same defect noted above in their
lines of defense.</p>
<p>From the bastion of San Gabriel to the gate of the Pari&aacute;n on
the east of the city, is located a false screen or barbacan with its
parapet and banquette. It is defective, for it is fallen, and has no
gate for the retreat of the soldiers. The gate of the Pari&aacute;n is
covered and defended by a small outer work in the form of a crown, and
the royal gate by a ravelin so poorly placed and so poorly ordered,
that it cannot defend the faces of the collateral bastions of San
Andr&eacute;s and of the foundry. The flanks of the two latter bastions
are not any more capable of defending the faces of the ravelin. It must
be added to the above that all those fortifications are very old and
defective: the walls; the chemise, or revetement, three feet thick at
the cordon, without counterfort; the escarp and counter-escarp fallen
in part; and almost everything useless. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>The covered way is very short and filled with thickets and bushes.
Its parapet is in ruins and it has no stockade or palisade. It is so
low, that it leaves the most essential parts of the bastions and
curtains open clear to the foot. The embrasures are poorly placed. The
gates on the sea side, are pierced through, and so old and so used up,
that they cannot offer any resistance at all. The esplanades of the
boulevards are so irregular and so rough, that it is impossible to
maneuver with the artillery, which, besides, was mounted on
ship&rsquo;s carriages so old that they could not be fired without
danger of being dismounted.</p>
<p>The royal fort of Santiago is composed of two demi-bastions which
dominate the city, and of a third one which points outward and prevents
the approach of the enemy. It has two circular platforms, and several
flanks intended for the same use. The curtains which unite these
bastions have no terreplein, and the places from which to fire are
distributed without any measure or proportion.</p>

<p>The garrison of this place consisted of the royal regiment, which
has been composed, since its creation, of twenty companies of one
hundred men apiece, under the command of captains, lieutenants, and
ensigns. These companies have never been full, and have never amounted
to fifteen hundred men. When the enemy arrived, this regiment was
diminished to such an extent both by the mortality and desertion of
some men, and by the different detachments which were told off for the
galleons and for other posts, that there were not more than five
hundred and fifty-six soldiers. There were only eighty cannoneers, and
those even were native Indians, who were but little <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>skilled in the management of artillery. At the
arrival of the enemy, four militia companies were formed, of sixty men
each, and called commercial troops.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2569src"
href="#xd27e2569" name="xd27e2569src">2</a></p>
<p>Manila never thought that it would be attacked by European nations.
It supported the security in which it existed on the distance and
remoteness of its position, in relation with Europe, and on the fact
that such an example had never happened, although the two crowns had
often been at war. In such confidence, they had been satisfied with
putting the place in a state of defense against the Moros and
neighboring nations who were little skilled in the art of war, the
management of large artillery, muskets, and in the terrible artifice of
throwing bombs, grenades, shells, etc. For in order that Manila might
be defended against European nations, it would have needed four
thousand well drilled men and all the corresponding equipment, things
which this city has lacked even to the present.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2574src" href="#xd27e2574" name="xd27e2574src">3</a></p>
<p>In this state of defense, on the twenty-second of September, 1762,
at half-past five in the evening, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>powerful fleet of
thirteen vessels was seen. Although so unexpected a novelty caused the
greatest surprise and the greatest astonishment, since there was no
news in Manila of the war, and it was not supposed even that it had
been declared, it was suspected nevertheless, that that was a hostile
fleet. Consequently, his Excellency, Archbishop Roxo, governor and
captain-general, gave on the spot the orders necessary and in
accordance with the circumstances, to put the place in a state of
defense, without forgetting to send to Cavite the help needed
there.</p>
<p>While the preparations for the defense were being made, it was
decided that it was necessary to write to the commander of the
squadron, in order to tell him that he was to announce his nationality,
for what purpose he had come, and the reason why he had entered the
bay, without first having announced himself. The following night, an
officer was assigned to bear this letter.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2590src" href="#xd27e2590" name="xd27e2590src">4</a> About eleven
o&rsquo;clock, next morning, a boat which had been sent from the
squadron, drew up to the fort. It bore two English officers, and ours
who was returning, with a communication signed by Admiral Samuel
Cornis, and by Brigadier-general Drapert, commander-in-chief of the
land forces of his Britannic Majesty assigned for the present
expedition. In their letter they announced that they were coming by
order of their sovereign, for the conquest of the islands.
Consequently, they urged that the city of Manila, its fortifications,
and its territory, be surrendered to them. If that were not done, or
indeed if any resistance were made (which they did not expect, unless
the authors of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111"
name="pb111">111</a>]</span>resistance were crazy), they had brought
formidable forces to make themselves masters of all the land by force
of arms, and they would immediately commence hostilities after hearing
the answer.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2598src" href="#xd27e2598" name=
"xd27e2598src">5</a></p>
<p>The captain-general answered them that the proposition which had
just been made could not be accepted by subjects so faithful to their
king, and that they were all resolved to sacrifice their lives for the
defense of religion and the honor of the arms of their
sovereign.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2606src" href="#xd27e2606" name=
"xd27e2606src">6</a></p>
<p>As soon as they had received the answer, the entire squadron began
to move about six o&rsquo;clock on the evening of the twenty-third.
They approached as near as possible to the south shore of the city,
opposite the reduct called San Antonio Abad, which was used as a
casemate, and which was one good half-league distant from the city.
That same night, and until daybreak, the people busied themselves in
taking all the gunpowder from that post. But it was necessary to
abandon the said post with some effects and a goodly quantity of
saltpetre, for the enemy landed at that same place, under support from
the artillery of their ships. They took possession of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>reduct as well as of the churches of
Malate,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2613src" href="#xd27e2613" name=
"xd27e2613src">7</a> Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia, and Santiago, of
the suburbs and shops along the seashore, between the church of San
Juan de Bagumbayan, which was eighty-five toises from the city, and the
reduct. That same night two pickets of musketeers were detached from
the garrison, commanded by &mdash;&mdash;, with orders to attack the
enemy, to dislodge them if possible, and to prevent at the same time,
the disembarking which was being continued along various places on the
shore. The pickets suffered a very severe fire from the musketry of the
enemy, who were stationed in the church of Santiago, and the
neighboring houses, so that they retired in disorder.</p>
<p>On the twenty-fourth, about eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, they
began to salute the enemy with artillery from the boulevards of the
foundry and from San Andr&eacute;s, but with little effect, because the
enemy were behind the churches which protected them.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2621src" href="#xd27e2621" name="xd27e2621src">8</a></p>
<p>At nine in the morning, a small galley entered the bay, coming from
the Embocadero of San Bernardino, with the news that the galleon
&ldquo;Philippino&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=
"#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>had anchored in Palapa, on its
return from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. The hostile squadron detached a swift
frigate and four armed chaloupes, which gave chase to the galley.
Having fired some shots at it, the galley made shore at Tambobo. At the
same time the majority of the people on that galley, soldiers and
passengers leaped into the water. Two chaloupes captured it. The
captain, a subaltern, who was in charge of the galley, and some persons
who had stayed aboard, were made prisoners of war. The chaloupes tried
to tow the galley, but not being able to succeed in it, they took all
that they could out of it,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2628src" href=
"#xd27e2628" name="xd27e2628src">9</a> except two six-pounder cannons
which they were unable to move; and thereupon abandoned the galley and
went back to their squadron. The captain-general had that galley set
afire, after the two cannons had been taken out of it.</p>
<p>The following night it was resolved to make a vigorous sortie in
order to discomfit the enemy who were fortifying themselves with all
haste in the churches of which we have just spoken, namely, Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora de Guia, Malate, and Santiago. Two four-pounders were
detached, with the necessary artillerymen and the men needed to manage
those cannons, fifty musketeers of the regular troops, some militiamen,
and eight hundred Indian natives with their spears. In charge of this
expedition was Monsieur Fayette (a Frenchman in the service of Manila).
He attacked the enemy at their posts.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2636src" href="#xd27e2636" name="xd27e2636src">10</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>The action lasted the greater part of the night,
with a sharp fire on both sides; but Monsieur Fayette having recognized
the invincible strength of the corps opposed to ours, and that fresh
forces were continually coming to the enemy, ordered our men to retire
a bit, and take position before the church of San Juan de Bagumbayan,
where he kept his post all night, firing on the church of Santiago
until nine o&rsquo;clock of the morning of the twenty-fifth, when all
the troops came back under protection of a new force which was sent
them from the city.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2644src" href=
"#xd27e2644" name="xd27e2644src">11</a> From that time <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>until three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon,
firing was suspended, because an officer of the hostile camp was
received in the place, who was charged with a special mission.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2660src" href="#xd27e2660" name=
"xd27e2660src">12</a></p>
<p>The bombardment continued without cessation. It did much damage to
the buildings and killed some persons. The bombs that were picked up
entire, were eighteen inches in diameter. They were kept to send back
to the enemy in two mortars which were found in the royal magazines.
That same night, some cannons loaded with grape were discharged on the
enemy. To it was joined a fusillade which produced a good effect, for
on the day of the twenty-sixth,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2668src"
href="#xd27e2668" name="xd27e2668src">13</a> several corpses were to be
seen from the place <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"
name="pb116">116</a>]</span>scattered between the glacis and the
hostile trenches. Some muskets that had been left by those killed were
picked up. Since the enemy did not take them away, their bodies were
buried in the bellies of hungry foxes and dogs which were very numerous
there, and which devoured them in a short time in the sight of our men
who manned the walls.</p>
<p>At eight in the morning, some Indian and mestizo spearmen presented
themselves before the enemy&rsquo;s trenches, without that movement on
their part having been preceded by any order. On approaching the
advanced outposts who were occupying the sacristies of the church of
San Juan de Bagumbayan, the bakery, and other neighboring houses, those
Indians (although few in number), threw themselves on the enemy with
such fury that they gained possession of the posts which have just been
mentioned. They drove out the hostile musketeers, wounding and killing
all that they met. But the English were promptly succored by a
re&euml;nforcement of three hundred fusileers, who regained the posts
that they had lost, and caused the Indians to retreat, to whom a signal
was made from the bastion of San Andres to leave a clear field so that
the fire of our artillery could have free play. The artillery did, by
this means, great harm to the enemy.</p>
<p>During the progress of this bloody action, an officer of the camp
was perceived, who was carrying a white flag. He was followed and
accompanied by a young man clad in black, and by a drummer beating the
chamade. The fire of our artillery was suspended, but the fusillade of
the enemy continued <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117"
name="pb117">117</a>]</span>with unequaled obstinacy, against the
Indian spearmen who always sustained that fire. Consequently, the
Indians attacked the English officer, killed him, and gave seven mortal
wounds to the young man who accompanied him. The drummer was also
killed, and another person who appeared to be the servant of the
officer. The Indians cut off the head of the latter, but not being
longer able to endure the hostile fire they retired to the covered way
of the royal gate, which was opened for them so that they could
re&euml;nter. Following are the facts of the case. The nephew of the
archbishop, Don Antonio Sierra de Tagle, having been made prisoner on
board the little galley and conducted aboard the flagship, of which we
have spoken above, the English commander-in-chief had offered in
advance to grant him his liberty, and the English officer was
conducting him for that purpose. That young man died of his
wounds.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2681src" href="#xd27e2681" name=
"xd27e2681src">14</a></p>
<p>During the whole of this day, the bombardment continued with fury,
the enemy having increased their batteries of the church of Santiago by
three mortars. After dinner an officer was despatched to the camp of
the enemy to agree upon a truce, so that they could take away the body
of their officer who had been killed. They did so, but many other dead
bodies were left. On our side also, some who had been wounded were
brought in.</p>
<p>On the morning of the twenty-eighth, a message was received from the
English commander-in-chief, who urgently demanded the head of the
English officer which the Indians had taken: as well as the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>author of that deed, with the threat that if it
were not done, he would send the heads of all the prisoners whom they
had in their power, and especially those of two officers, who had been
made prisoners aboard the little galley. That demand was completely
satisfied, and we were exculpated from a deed in which we had no part,
and the blame for which was to be attributed to the lack of civilized
customs among the Indians, and especially to the Sepoys, who, as has
been said, did not cease to continue hostilities by their constant
fire. Our captain-general (the archbishop), mounted on horseback, and
went to see the hostile camp, in order to appease the trouble that that
affair had aroused, and in fact it did not go farther.</p>
<p>The bombardment continued without cessation, and from half-past five
in the evening until seven the flagship and another ship fired on the
city, but with very slight result, for the balls which were fired
horizontally were all buried on the shore, and those to which they gave
a slight elevation, nearly all passed over the city, and were lost on
the other side.</p>
<p>That same day, two mortars were fixed and placed in a battery on the
rampart of the foundry, with which many bombs were thrown into the
hostile camp and into the trenches.</p>
<p>On the twenty-ninth,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2700src" href=
"#xd27e2700" name="xd27e2700src">15</a> at six in the morning, the
flagship and another vessel commenced to cannonade the bastion of the
foundry, and made a desperate fire, which continued until eight
o&rsquo;clock with the same activity. From that time until ten it was
moderated. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>In the afternoon of that same day, two craft
entered by way of the great strait (of Mariveles). Immediately two of
the enemy&rsquo;s squadron were detached, which having joined the two
which were coming, anchored with them near Manila. It was learned
afterward that those craft were two English frigates, which had become
separated from the body of the squadron in a great storm; as was also
the case with the &ldquo;Namur,&rdquo; which had lost its masts and had
been forced to put in at Canton. Hence their total squadron numbered
sixteen sail.</p>
<p>The thirtieth, the bombardment continued, and the vessels fired some
shots from their cannons.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2710src" href=
"#xd27e2710" name="xd27e2710src">16</a> From the city four chaloupes
were seen which had overturned; they were coming ashore with men and
war supplies. The same accident happened to a champan which they had
captured in the days preceding. This accident had happened through the
violence of the west wind which had freshened. This was at four in the
afternoon, and at six, a bomb-ketch made shore opposite the reduct of
San Antonio Abad.</p>
<p>October first, the Indians of Passay reported that a raft had made
the shore, which was built of large masts, small masts, and yards that
had belonged to the bomb-ketch; that this raft had on it the moorings,
and artillery of the above bomb-ketch. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>reported that they had seen many people drowned
on the beach. Upon this report, the native cavalry was detached in
order that they might seize those effects. But when they arrived at the
place, they were repulsed by the enemy&rsquo;s musketry, who had
hastened from their general quarter of Malate and from the powder
factory in order to protect the raft and its load.</p>
<p>At daybreak of the second, the enemy placed in operation a battery
of eight twenty-four pounders against the flanked angle of the bastion
of the foundry, and against the face which looked upon their camp. That
battery was so well served, that at ten in the morning, all the parapet
of that part was on the ground. At the same time, they directed their
mortars (nine in number and of various calibers) toward the bastion
itself. The flagship and another vessel bombarded the same bastion on
the side looking seaward, with such fury that along the shore and
beyond the walls on the landside, more than four thousand twenty-four
pound balls were collected. But what molested us still more was the
musketry of the enemy, which was placed in the tower and church of
Santiago, which they had arranged for that purpose by opening in all
the roofs several windows so that they dominated us. They saw also all
that occurred in the city, and although the greatest efforts and the
most powerful attempts were made to batter down the church with our
artillery, we were unable to do it, or to dislodge the enemy from that
post. But it is incredible that our bastion being open without a
parapet on either side, it is incredible, I say, that of the various
officers who sustained it, and of all the musketeers and artillerymen
who were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>obliged to fire in barbet, there were killed
only two artillerymen, two musketeers, and three pioneers, in spite of
a desperate fire which all those men suffered from five different
parts. It is true that more than twenty wounded and maimed were taken
out, among whom was a lieutenant belonging to the artillery who lost
his right arm. The greater part of the officers were wounded and
bruised from blows with stones, and had contusions, but that did not
prevent them from sticking to their posts. The vessels ceased their
fire at orisons. That of the camp continued all night with the same
activity, so that the artillery of our bastion having been dismounted,
they were obliged to abandon that post, leaving there only a few
sentinels without shelter.</p>
<p>At the same time, various assemblies and parties of Indians from the
provinces were formed to the number of five thousand more or less. But
only two thousand five hundred Pampangos were found who were deemed
capable of undertaking anything. Consequently, it was resolved to make
a sortie.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2726src" href="#xd27e2726" name=
"xd27e2726src">17</a> It was to be undertaken at the close of the night
of the third, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>as follows. The Pampangos were to form in three
columns. The first column was to attack the church of Santiago on the
side where the enemies had their batteries of cannons and mortars. The
second was to hurl itself on Malate and Ermita where the general
quarters were located. The third was to invest by the sea side. Those
three columns were to be supported by two pickets of musketeers,
commanded by the sargento-mayor of Cavite, two captains, and four
subalterns. At the hour set, our Pampangos and pickets sallied out in
the best order, but scarce had they set foot outside the Pari&aacute;n
gate, when they began to utter loud cries in disorder and make a great
racket. That allowed the camp of the enemy to get into readiness to
receive them. In spite of that, the Pampango troops entered their camp,
killed the advance sentinels, and caused great damage to the enemy.
Those Indians themselves suffered no less from the hostile musketry.
They would have suffered still more if confusion had not reigned there;
for the enemy, in their fear of killing one another, did not dare to
play some cannon loaded with grape, which they had prepared and posted
in different places. The pickets seeing this disorder, halted before
the church of San Juan de Bagumbayan, whence they fired against the
church of Santiago, thus protecting the retreat of the Pampangos, which
took place at nine in the morning. The action was bloody on both sides.
One soldier of the pickets was killed and eight wounded. The mortality
among the Pampangos was heavy. It was learned afterward that the enemy
having lost some of their officers, who were killed in the action, had
had more than sixty Pampangos, whom they had captured and taken
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>prisoners, hanged in their camp. That action so
intimidated and disconcerted all the other Pampangos that they all
retired to their respective villages, so that there remained very few
of them who would return to Manila.</p>
<p>That action did not at all interrupt the fire of the battery against
the bastion of the foundry, so that when daybreak came, it could be
seen that an eighteen-pounder cannon had fallen into the ditch, and it
could not be recovered. The greater part of the face and the terreplein
of the same bastion had also fallen, and their ruins had dried up the
ditch. But what caused the greatest anxiety was that the engineer
recognized that the enemy was busy making a new battery for the purpose
of dismounting the artillery, the collateral flanks of the bastions San
Andr&eacute;s and San Eugenio, which flanked and defended the entrance
to the covered way and the approach to the breach. In fact, that
battery began to play at noon with so great activity, that it
dismounted the cannons of the flanks in two hours time, overthrew the
parapets, and killed some fusileers and pioneers. Twice were other
parapets made with beams and bags of sand, but each time they were in
ruins the moment after. Consequently, the men were obliged to retire
from those bastions. The bastion of San Andr&eacute;s did not suffer so
much, for it was stronger. However, it had one cannon of the caliber of
eighteen, which was placed in the elevated flank, dismounted. We had no
other hope than in another cannon of equal caliber, of the two which
were in this flank, for while we still had two cannons of the caliber
of four in the low place, the latter could be of but little service.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>Our captain-general, having been informed of everything, called the
council of war in the afternoon of the same day; and that council
lasted until the night. The master-of-camp, the sargento-mayor of the
city, the sargento-mayor of Cavite, the sargento-mayor of the royal
regiment, those of the militia, and the deputies of the merchant body,
of the city, and of the various ecclesiastic orders were present, all
being introduced by the ordinary engineer. The latter, having reported
the fatal condition of the place, advice or opinions were mutually
given. All, with the exception of the military men, were of the opinion
to continue the defense, by making use of the ordinary means for the
repairs necessary to the bastions, and by making ditches, etc. The
military men thought that we ought to capitulate.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2738src" href="#xd27e2738" name="xd27e2738src">18</a> But having
asked them whether they thought that we ought to capitulate
immediately, they answered no, and that they said it only because the
breach had commenced, and that it would be practicable next day, and it
would be difficult to make the ditches and repairs necessary to prevent
the city from being taken by assault.</p>
<p>Having been informed of everything, our captain-general gave the
orders and made all the preparations necessary for beginning the work,
and for making the proposed ditches. He watched all the operations and
all the movements of the enemy.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2746src"
href="#xd27e2746" name="xd27e2746src">19</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>At dawn on the fourth, the enemy began to fire shells into the city.
They set fire to several of the buildings, and together with the shot
from the mortar batteries and the fusillade from the tower of Santiago,
which resembled a shower of hail, threw the garrison and the
inhabitants into great consternation, which gradually
increased.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2758src" href="#xd27e2758" name=
"xd27e2758src">20</a> All the day of the fourth, and the following
night, were passed in this perplexity, no means being found by which to
escape the danger. Although orders for the ditches and the defense of
the breach were renewed, in order to prevent the assault, and activity
was redoubled and the necessary efforts made, yet there was no means of
executing any of those things, because of the continual and deadly fire
of the enemy.</p>
<p>Consequently, there was no means of getting the bearers of fascines
to work. Finally, at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning of the fifth, the
enemy&rsquo;s troops left their posts in three columns. The first
directed its course toward the breach; the second toward the royal
gate; and the third marched along the highway surrounding the covered
way, toward the east and bordering on the plaza de armas.</p>
<p>The few soldiers left us occupied the gorge of the bastion of the
foundry, the royal gate, the flank of the bastion of San Andr&eacute;s,
and the curtain joining them. The enemy were supported by their
batteries <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>and by the fusileers of the tower of Santiago,
who poured in a steady fire. Consequently, it was impossible for ours
to occupy the breach in order to defend the approach. The approaching
columns discharged two rounds with their muskets, by which they swept
the two collateral bastions, the curtain, and all the posts which could
oppose them. Finally, all together, they mounted the breach, and seized
the bastion of the foundry. At the same instant they attacked the royal
gate, which they battered down with axes and iron levers.</p>
<p>After some slight opposition on our side, some officers who were
there, not being able to defend those posts, the enemy fired from there
on the other posts which they seized also following the cordon, and
went to present themselves before the fort whither the governor and
captain-general had retired.</p>
<p>At that moment, the militia, the regular troops, and the Indians who
were in that fort, threw themselves in disorder from the top of the
walls. Many threw themselves into the river, where a number of them
were drowned. Consequently, when the captain-general reached the fort,
he found only the castellan, Monsieur Pignon, his second, and one
artilleryman. The few troops that he found were in confusion and were
throwing themselves from the wall. The enemy&rsquo;s column which
entered by the royal gate directed its course toward the plaza de armas
and seized the palace.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2771src" href=
"#xd27e2771" name="xd27e2771src">21</a> That which marched by the
highway, took the small fort which defends <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>the
bridge across the Pasig River. Thence it went to the city, entering by
the Pari&aacute;n gate.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2776src" href=
"#xd27e2776" name="xd27e2776src">22</a></p>
<p>The fort flung a white flag, and terms of capitulation were
proposed, which the British officers refused to accept. At the same
moment the colonel pressed the fort to surrender, else indeed
hostilities would be continued and arms used. The captain-general
pressed and greatly embarrassed, resolved to go in person with the
colonel, under the good faith of the guaranty of his person in order to
treat concerning the capitulation with the general. In fact, they
discussed the matter at length in the palace. The archbishop desired to
have military honors accorded, insisting on this point several times
but not being able to obtain it. He was compelled to give an order for
the surrender of the fort, and all the men were made prisoners of war
with the exception of the captain-general. The military were granted
the honor of keeping their swords and the repeated demands of the
captain-general could obtain nothing else.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2784src" href="#xd27e2784" name="xd27e2784src">23</a></p>
<p>The city was given over to pillage, which was cruel and lasted for
forty hours, without excepting the churches, the archbishopric, and a
part of the palace. Although the captain-general objected at the end of
twenty-four hours, the pillage really continued, in spite of the orders
of the British general for it to cease. He himself killed with his own
hand a soldier whom he found transgressing his orders, and had three
hanged.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2789src" href="#xd27e2789" name=
"xd27e2789src">24</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href=
"#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the doings of that day, the sargento-mayor of the royal regiment,
two captains, two subalterns, about fifty soldiers of the regular
troops, and thirty of the commerce militia were killed on our side, and
many were wounded.</p>
<p>In the other doings, and especially in the last sortie, more than
three hundred Indians were killed, and more than four hundred
wounded.</p>
<p>The number killed on the side of the enemy we have not been able to
learn exactly. It has been learned only by some circumstances, that in
the review made two days after the taking of the place, the enemy had
lost more than a thousand men, among whom were sixteen officers. Among
those officers, was a sargento-mayor of Drapert&rsquo;s regiment, who
was killed on the day of the assault by an arrow; and the commandant of
the regiment of Chamal, who was killed by a musket ball, as he was
watching with a glass the approach from the tower of Santiago. The
vice-admiral<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2807src" href="#xd27e2807"
name="xd27e2807src">25</a> was drowned when coming ashore in a small
boat which overturned; and the same accident caused the death of some
sailors and soldiers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href=
"#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>The forces of the enemy consisted of fifteen hundred European
soldiers, chosen from Drapert&rsquo;s regiment, and from the battalion
of the volunteers of Chamal; two artillery companies of sixty men
apiece; three thousand European sailors, fusileers and well
disciplined; eight hundred Sepoys, with muskets, forming two
battalions, and fourteen hundred of the same troops destined for the
fascines. That formed an army of six thousand eight hundred and thirty
men.</p>
<p>The two mortar batteries, which, as has been said, were of different
caliber, threw more than five thousand bombs into the city.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2816src" href="#xd27e2816" name=
"xd27e2816src">26</a> The land batteries and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=

thousand shots from twenty-four pounders, and ruined the city in many
places. The enemy sent about twenty-five <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>shells, which set
fires in five different places; and if all diligence had not been
employed, the city, or the greater part of it, would have been in
ashes. Manila, December 23, 1762. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132"

&ldquo;The English knew as much of the weakness of that city as the
Spaniards themselves, because of the voyages that they made there
annually. There was (and the same was true in 1766 and 1767) the
greatest freedom of going everywhere, of seeing and visiting
everything. When I left that city, I could easily have given an idea of
the plan of the fortifications of that place. The Spaniards were
without distrust in this regard. The English knew besides that the
garrison was very weak, and composed of Mexican soldiers, good enough
indeed, but of little skill in the military art, as they had never
fired a gun; and composed, in a word, of soldiers, sufficient to impose
on Negroes, but incapable of opposing well disciplined troops,

sortie, Le Gentil says (ii, p. 243): &ldquo;This sortie was only a kind
of boast and bravado, for how could one flatter himself, with at the
most sixty men (for I do not take any account of the eight hundred
Indians and two small cannons) that he could give any trouble to six
thousand men of good troops, withdrawn into two or three citadels,
which it would really have been necessary to have besieged in order to
try to dislodge them; for the walls of all these churches are made of
cut stone, and are as thick as the walls of the royal observatory,
namely, five or six feet thick, and are octagonal.&rdquo; The
re&euml;nforcements sent to Fayette consisted of two Spanish companies
and 1,500 Indians, commanded by Pedro Iriarte; and later one other
company commanded by Fernando de Araya.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Opinions are divided as to the conduct of
Fayette (Fallet), some accusing him of treason and others exonerating
him. Ferrando (iv, p. 623) says, when speaking of his night sortie,
that he retired only because of superior numbers, and adds:
&ldquo;Without reason and justice, the suspicion of treason against the
French official (Sr. Fallet) who directed that sortie according to good
principles of [military] science (which do not always triumph over
tenfold the number of legions), would lie then on the conscience of the
country.&rdquo; At the assault, however (<i lang="la">ut supra</i>, p.
628), Fayette, who was ordered to guard the breach in the wall, was
with some reason accused of treason because of the lukewarmness which
he displayed in its defense; and because he finally went over to the
British lines, being received there gladly. In fact when the British
were forming for the assault Fayette had ordered the Indian archers to
retire from the breach under pretext of taking some refreshment and
rest before the assault&mdash;which was well calculated to aggravate
suspicions. The English, seeing this move, were quick to take advantage
of it. Monterory Vidal says (ii, p. 27) that he played the traitor at
the assault by not offering any resistance. The Marquis de Ayerbe
(<i lang="es">Sitio y conquista</i>, p. 44) calls him a
Swiss.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd27e2644src">&uarr;</a></p>

was doubtless the officer with the second British summons for
surrender. It was probably at the council held in consequence of this
(see <i>ante</i>, note 38), that the fiscal, Leandro de Viana, was
appointed to see after the supply of provisions for the defense of the
city. He issued orders to the alcaldes-mayor of the various provinces,
and to the procurators of the convents, from whose estates much rice
and other effects were received. Viana advised the archbishop to leave
all military matters to the sargentos-mayor of Manila and Cavite, but
the latter refused to do so. See Montero y Vidal, ii, p.

in three columns: the first in command of Francisco Rodr&iacute;guez
and their valiant leader Manalastas; the second in command of Santiago
Orenda&iacute;n; and the third, in command of the volunteers Esclava

empty, but were driven thence by the British. The second bore down upon
Ermita, where they were at first successful, but were speedily driven
back by the British, with a loss of 200 men, Orenda&iacute;n fleeing at
the beginning of the engagement, which is regarded as proof of his
treachery. The third column, which was to have attacked by the sea
side, grew faint hearted and retreated. Many natives, alarmed because
the British had hanged more than sixty Pampangos whom they had
captured, returned to their homes. See Montero y Vidal, ii, pp. 22,

Ferrando (iv, p. 631) says: &ldquo;Finally the killing ceased, but the
sack continued contrary to the previous agreement, without the lewdness
of the soldiers pardoning either the honor of the married women or the
virginity of girls, who were everywhere the victims of their brutal
appetites&#8202;&hellip;. According to old histories, many young women,
who had taken refuge during the danger, at the beaterio of Santa Rosa
of this city of Manila, were violated. The venerable mother Paula,
foundress and directress of said institution, asserted that not one of
the girl boarders and collegiates of the house had been violated by the
brutal soldiery.&rdquo;</p>

following account of the assault is taken from Le Gentil, ii, pp.
252&ndash;255:</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;Archbishop Roxo was a capable man for
the good management of finances. He was clever in business and very
zealous for the service of the king. But he did not understand anything
of military affairs. Consequently, the factions which were formed, and
which he was unable to resist, were the cause of his not capitulating
in time, and those factions caused the misfortune of Manila.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;It would be difficult to form an idea
of the embarrassment in which this prelate found himself, and of the
consternation of the entire village. I have been assured that the name
of Arandia, that man whom the friars had, two years previously, dubbed
a heretic, and toward whom they had been so hostile that no one could
be found who would take charge of his funeral oration, was heard
pronounced several times. &lsquo;If Arandia were living,&rsquo; said
one, several times during the siege. It was perceived then that they
lacked a man to direct. Several times the archbishop wished to
capitulate, but he was prevented. Don Andres Roxo has assured me very
emphatically, that had the archbishop been alone, and had he not been
besieged on one side by the auditors, and on the other by the friars,
he would not have waited until the English had mounted to the assault.
It was in fine a notorious fact at the time of my stay in Manila, that
the fiscal and especially an auditor, who has died since my departure,
were the cause of Roxo not capitulating in time. Many councils, indeed,
were held, but nothing was determined there. These councils, besides,
were very illy made up; for, if the military men were excused from it,
what good could come from appealing from the auditors there, who knew
nothing in this line, and from fanatic friars. The latter made use of
Mother Paula, whom they pretended had had visions of St. Francis. They
carried the news of those visions to the archbishop, and did what they
could to support him in the flattering idea that St. Francis would work
a miracle in favor of the inhabitants of Manila and that one would see
him on the breach, with his cord in his hand, defending and sustaining
the assault, as he had formerly repulsed the Chinese, who, so they said
at Manila, had risen against this city to the number of more than
twenty thousand.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;While the English were pressing Manila,
the auditors were besieging the archbishop, and prevented any one from
approaching to speak with him. Monsieur Fayette, more experienced than
the other officers, seeing the evident danger which was threatening the
city, tried, in spite of the difficulty in penetrating thither, into
the presence of the archbishop, to leap the barrier. Auditor
&mdash;&mdash; was performing constant guard duty in the anti-chamber.
It was impossible for Monsieur Fayette to get nearer. He told the
auditor what brought him. The latter sent him back very roughly, giving
him to understand that he was an ignoramus in the trade; that the
governor was better informed than he; that the ministers of the king,
who were there to assist the governor by their counsels, knew all that
was to be done. &lsquo;Do you take us,&rsquo; said he in wrath,
&lsquo;do you take us for traitors to our fatherland? Do we not know
our obligations?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;Monsieur Fayette retired. That same
afternoon, the archbishop desired to go in person to view the breach (a
fact that has been attested to me) but Auditor &mdash;&mdash; and the
fiscal prevented him. They did not wish, they said, to have his most
illustrious Lordship expose himself to so evident a danger. It is true
that, since they were near his person in order to assist him with their
counsels, it would have been necessary for the two auditors to have
accompanied him in his visit.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;Don Andres Roxo has shown me a copy of
one of the letters written to the king by this prelate, when he was
near death, in which he gave his Majesty an account of his conduct, and
asked his pardon for the errors which he had committed. When speaking
of the matter that we have just seen concerning the visit to the
breach, he says &lsquo;Would to God that a cannon ball had then
shortened my days.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;Next morning bout six o&rsquo;clock,
the same officer (Monsieur Fayette) returned to make a second attempt.
He succeeded finally in getting quite into the apartment of the
archbishop, but it was after he had deceived and thrown the watchful
auditor off his guard. It was then too late to deliberate. A messenger
announced that the enemy were at the breach, in possession of the
bastion of the foundry.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;The English were divided into three
columns. The one which was to mount the breach was preceded by thirty
volunteers and pioneers who were the first to mount, but who probably
well knew that they would find but very little or no opposition.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;The breach was scarcely practicable,
and these volunteers had some difficulty in mounting. Arrived at the
bastion, they saw no one to dispute the ground with them. They cried
out to their comrades that they had found no obstacles, and in fact,
the few people that had been stationed on the bastion had become
affrighted, and had fled in both directions along the wall. Some even
threw themselves down from the walls. The column seeing that these
volunteers met no resistance on the bastion, bravely mounted the
breach, and took the bastion. The volunteers went to the royal gate,
where they found a feeble guard, who, frightened, had taken refuge
under an altar of the Virgin which was in the guardhouse, and before
which all the guard were wont to recite the rosary night and morning.
The guard thought that they were safe from all danger, but the English,
having few scruples, massacred them. They opened the gates to the rest
of the troops, who were only Sepoys, who composed the second column.
Thus was Manila taken by assault.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

only have a right to what the sack gave them in itself in the territory
gained by them. The rest is absurdly and ill surrendered, and contrary
to all rights of war. Consequently, if this letter reaches you in time,
I summon your Excellency, in his Majesty&rsquo;s name, once and a

islands. And should it be already signed, I protest to your Excellency
the wrong and that I shall in no wise obey so unjust and absurd a
treaty. If the British wish to dominate this country, their chiefs know
that it must be by first gaining it <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>with their arms
according to right of war, but to surrender it through the panic of
terror, like children, would be a vileness and treason, which I shall
not permit so long as I am governor, and which does not belong to my
loyalty. Your Excellency also tells me that I received your commission
before the surrender, and that my just proceedings must be regulated to
this event and to this time. I answer also by asking your Excellency to
please explain a trifle more clearly in regard to the security that I
alone shall have by my just proceedings, which cannot be one jot turned
aside from loyalty to the king (whom may God preserve) and besides from
these provinces, without giving or allowing terms for their foreign
execution to the slightest degree.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2947src"
href="#xd27e2947" name="xd27e2947src">8</a> Your Excellency gave me
your commission before the surrender of that city, in order that I
might maintain these provinces under the dominion of his Majesty after
the fatal event which was feared.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2950src"
href="#xd27e2950" name="xd27e2950src">9</a> In any other way the
commission would have been superfluous. And is it possible that without
regarding consequences, your Excellency tells me to faithfully observe
the treaties with the British leaders, and that I regulate my just
procedures to the result and the time of the surrender of that city? If
your Excellency, although a vassal of the king of Espa&ntilde;a, his
minister, and so honored, counsels me after this manner, what is
allowed to the British leaders?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2956src"
href="#xd27e2956" name="xd27e2956src">10</a> Your Excellency
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>knows that when I left that capital, you did not
give me the royal seal, without which no Audiencia provision can be
despatched. I beg your Excellency to please have it sent to me, or to
have the lieutenant of the grand Chancillor come to exercise his
employment, if he is not detained in that capital.</p>
<p>[The archbishop answers Anda&rsquo;s letter on the twenty-third,
ordering him to present himself before him by the twenty-fifth, without
fail. He sends the translation of a passport given by the English,
which he attests (while keeping the original), so that Anda may come
safely.]<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2963src" href="#xd27e2963" name=
"xd27e2963src">11</a></p>
<p>[Anda, however, does not trust in the passport, as shown by his
letter of October 25, in answer to that of the archbishop. In this
letter he protests that he is a faithful vassal of the king, and since
he is not a vassal of the archbishop, and since he knows nothing of the
terms of the treaty that has been made with the British, he refuses to
go to Manila. Such conduct would make him run the risk of being called
a traitor to his king. He is greatly exasperated because the archbishop
has not sent the original passport, but instead a translation attested
by himself as a true copy, while he retains the original in his
possession in order that it may run no risks. This copy means nothing,
as the British soldiers will pay no attention to a passport signed by
the archbishop and purporting to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140"
href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>come from their own
commander, whereas they would recognize and obey the signature of the
latter. Besides, the date of the passport is the twenty-fifth,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2971src" href="#xd27e2971" name=
"xd27e2971src">12</a> and that could not be. In the passport also, the
archbishop acts as the clerk of the British, and in his letter as a
minister of the Catholic monarch, but the two capacities are not
conformable. Lastly, Anda cannot leave the natives secretly (as the
archbishop has suggested), as they love him so that they will not allow
him out of their sight, and he must not leave them or risk his
person.]</p>
<p>[In his reply to Anda, on the twenty-sixth of October,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2976src" href="#xd27e2976" name=
"xd27e2976src">13</a> the archbishop complains bitterly of the
former&rsquo;s lack of courtesy in his letter of the twenty-fifth, in
omitting his name and title as captain and governor-general. His
letter, the archbishop declares, is full of nonsense. It is a specious
pretext to boast of being a good vassal, but it is not a mark of
loyalty to seize authority belonging to another, by which he has
incited trouble among both Spaniards and natives. On account of his
absurd action, the British leaders have proscribed him and placed a
price on his head, as a disturber of the provinces. The archbishop had
sent the translated copy of the passport for Anda&rsquo;s own safety,
but he sends the original now, and thus places all the risk on
Anda&rsquo;s own shoulders. Although he is obliged for the present to
endure these insults thrust upon him by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>Anda and those who
imitate him, in order to avoid scandal, a time will come when he will
compel their obedience. He informs Anda that the English calendar is
one day in advance of that of the Spanish in the Orient. He protests
his loyalty and Anda&rsquo;s excesses.]</p>
<p>[On October 30, the archbishop issues a manifesto to &ldquo;the
faithful natives and their leaders of these Philipinas
Islands.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2983src" href="#xd27e2983"
name="xd27e2983src">14</a> Writing as archbishop and governor, he
informs them that the city of Manila has been taken by assault by the
English on the fifth of October, after a vigorous defense. The British
are enemies, but are most generous and cultured and have granted
freedom of worship, and permission for the people to proceed freely
with their trade, on condition of the payment of four million pesos,
and the surrender of all the fortifications of the islands with
military honors to alcaldes and officers. The British ask only that the
people keep quiet (the islands being as it were, a deposit), until
their monarch and the Spanish ruler come to terms. The natives are to
be for the present subordinate to the British, although their loyalty
to the Spanish king is not to be lessened. At some length, the
archbishop entreats the natives to attend to their religious duties,
and not to turn aside to listen to the vulgar. They must maintain good
relations with the British, for these, although conquerors, live in
harmony with the Spaniards and if their soldiers commit any wrongs
against the natives <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span>they will be punished. Reward and
punishment alike will come from God.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2994src" href="#xd27e2994" name="xd27e2994src">15</a></p>
<p>Again on November 4, the archbishop writes to Anda. In it he states
that he has been recognized throughout his negotiations as the
representative of the Spanish monarch, and the true governor and
captain-general, and that he is not a prisoner. Much harm has resulted
from Anda&rsquo;s provisions, which he has enacted as royal. By his
order to cut off provisions from Manila, he has succeeded in angering
the British against the Spaniards and natives in Manila; and it will
result in the British carrying their conquest further by going out into
the provinces to get food, and the Spaniards in Manila will all perish
of hunger if they are not first put to the sword. This will mean the
extinction of the Spaniards and the destruction of Christianity in the
islands, the maintenance of which is the only object of the Spanish
monarch. Anda can see how much service he is doing to the king by his
actions. He must not congratulate himself that the British are few, for
they number over six thousand, and they have a swift craft by which
they can easily descend on the fortifications in the islands.
Anda&rsquo;s action in ordering the removal of the treasury to Pampanga
is bad, for that money could have been included in the four millions
demanded by the British, one million of which is demanded immediately.
Besides the generals will cease to advance the necessary money for the
payments incumbent upon the king, as now, and for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>which the archbishop gives orders on the king to
them. The archbishop is not under obligation to communicate the
articles of capitulation to Anda, as the latter requests, as they are
only due the king. The result of the councils in which the capitulation
was made has been signed by the royal Audiencia and the archbishop, and
the former has only had the courage to make separately a protest, which
the archbishop made openly to the generals. They have not been able to
resist the promise of the four millions for a ransom. It was to be
raised from the money in the treasury, and that on board the ship
&ldquo;Philipino&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3004src" href=
"#xd27e3004" name="xd27e3004src">16</a> if the latter were not already
captured by the British. The remainder is to be paid by the king. For
the contribution of one million, demanded immediately, the silver in
the churches has been given with the exception of the chalices, cups,
and monstrances, although the sum raised by this means and by the
efforts of the citizens does not reach that amount. The archbishop has
given all his plate and pectorals. He closes by strictly ordering Anda
to revoke and cease to enact royal provisions, and cause disturbances
which are opposed to the service of the king. Anda is sufficiently
honored by his commission, and if he executes that prudently, the
pacification of the villages will ensue, for which purpose it was
given. The archbishop has had a right to enter into the negotiations
that have taken place in regard to the surrender of Manila and its
environs.]</p>
<p>[An edict signed by &ldquo;Dauzon Drak,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3009src" href="#xd27e3009" name="xd27e3009src">17</a> the English
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>governor at Manila, and by others, on November
4, states that since the governor (<i>i.e.</i>, Archbishop Rojo),
together with the auditors, has conceded to the English the island of
Luz&oacute;n with the adjacent islands belonging to said government,
according to the agreement made between Samuel Cornis, commander of the
water forces, and Guillermo Draper, commander of the land forces of the
British; and since &ldquo;the government of Manila is conferred on us
Daussone Drake and his council: we announce to all&rdquo; the natives
living in the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga, freedom to practice
the Roman Catholic religion, and exemption from all tributes and
personal services imposed by the Spaniards. Further, they are to have
all the privileges of British subjects, &ldquo;provided they
immediately renounce the subjection and obedience that they have given
to their auditor, Don Simon de Anda y Salazar, who has dared to violate
the agreement made between the abovesaid generals commanding and his
Excellency, the governor and captain-general of the royal Audiencia of
these islands, who declares himself by his own act the governor and
captain-general of all the islands, without any authority, and is now a
declared rebel and disobedient to the two Majesties in the said
districts.&rdquo; If the natives behave peacefully, no violence will be
shown them, but if they obstinately continue to follow Anda, they will
be treated as rebels.]</p>
<p>[An order of Anda, dated Bacolor, November 11, provides for the safe
arrival of the Chinese vessels which will come for the trade at the
regular time of the monsoon, and the boat commanded by Antonio Pacheco
which has been trading in China. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>alcalde-mayor of the
province of Zambales is ordered to set a sentinel at Cape Bolinao, in
order that he may give advice of the coming of any boat, so that it may
be warned not to enter the bay of Manila, now in the control of the
English, but to go to the province of Cagayan instead, where the
Chinese can hold their fair. The abovesaid alcalde-mayor is to provide
for the sentinels, eight in number (two of them corporals) who are to
be given the same rations as those of the island of Corregidor. Eight
soldiers (two of them corporals) who are to be furnished in connection
with this duty by the alcalde-mayor of Pangasinan are to be provided
for by the latter at the royal expense from the coffers of that
province.]</p>
<p>[From Bacolor, Anda addresses a letter to &ldquo;Governors of the
natives, officials of justice and war, chiefs, cabezas de barangay, and
all the natives of the village of Binalotongan, in the province of
Pangazam,&rdquo; under date of November 18. He has been informed by
their alcalde-mayor and the provincial vicar, Andres Melendez,
<abbr title="Ordinis Praedicatorum">O.P.</abbr>, of the village of
Lingayen, that they had revolted, and that, in order to quiet them,
certain demands, which they had made, had been granted for the present
in a signed paper. Now, if ever, when the country is beset with foreign
foes, is their perfect loyalty needed. In regard to the signed paper,
Anda declares that they ought not to make use of, but rather, burn it.
That they be excused from paying the rest of the tribute due from them,
until Anda and the government be again in Manila, is preposterous. That
demand shows that they believe that the government will not have the
strength to re&euml;stablish itself there. Now, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>indeed, they ought to aid with more than the
tribute, which is their recognition of vassalage to the Spanish
monarch, in fact, with their lives, possessions, and services, but
nothing more than the tribute due is asked from them. All the other
villages pay the tribute. Two regiments of Tag&aacute;logs and
Pampangos are being formed to defend the country against the English,
with their own arms and the king&rsquo;s pay. Their village alone has
complained, and is become a reproach to the others, which look askance
at it. Anda is certain that they will desist from their attempts and
contribute the rest of their tribute. Another of the points in the
paper that was signed is that they have demanded the dismissal of two
cabezas de barangay, who they declare have shamed them when their first
petition was presented in the tribunal; but Anda does not even know
what the petition was nor how they were shamed. They ought to present
their case in the regular way, and not forcibly dismiss the two cabezas
de barangay. Let them be restored to their places and their petition
filed before Anda, who promises to judge it rightly. They have also
asked that neither the prison guard of four men whom they were bound to
furnish, nor a money equivalent for their services if they were not
furnished, be longer demanded. That is a great abuse, and cannot be
allowed. Their contention that no justice should be appointed who does
not come from their midst, Anda approves. If the paper was signed
through fear of arms and in order to quiet them, it is null and void,
and he who holds it is in danger of being regarded as a traitor. Anda
asks them to send him the paper in order that he may destroy it, and to
thus prove their loyalty. The troops <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>of Bulacan and
Pampanga are about to take the field against the English. Anda had
intended to ask them, but recent developments have decided against
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3033src" href="#xd27e3033" name=
"xd27e3033src">18</a>]</p>
<p>[A communication from Anda, dated Bacolor, December 21, recites the
conditions of pardon for the Sangleys of Guagua concerned in the
conspiracy of the day before.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3038src" href=
"#xd27e3038" name="xd27e3038src">19</a> These are as follows: 1.
Surrender of all their arms, and examination of their houses, without
any resistance. 2. Married Sangleys in the villages of the province to
be restored to their houses, if not in too great number. 3. Both
married and single Sangleys of Guagua to move with families and
possessions to places indicated by government. 4. Must not keep arms
henceforth, nor go the villages of Lubao, Guagua, Sesmoan,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3044src" href="#xd27e3044" name=
"xd27e3044src">20</a> and Mecabebe, as those places are the keys of the
province. 5. Must take out necessary and usual licenses. Certain
captains are ordered to inform the Sangleys of these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>conditions, and to examine the houses in search
of hidden arms which are to be confiscated. A classified register of
all Chinese by villages is to be made; and for the present soldiers are
to be quartered on them. On the twenty-second, the governor of the
village of Apalit is ordered to go immediately in pursuit of the
Sangleys who fled from Guagua, and in case of resistance and refusal to
surrender to kill them all. If they surrender, they are to be taken to
Bacolor. The same order is given to the governors of Calumpit, Hagonoy,
and Malolos. On the same date, the governor of Guagua is ordered to
forbid the sale of nipa wine and destroy all found in the taverns, in
order to avoid the possibility of drunkenness and offenses against God,
especially now &ldquo;when it is feared that the Sangleys are coming
from Manila with the English, according to the treaty which the latter
have made with the Sangleys of this province.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[A series of documents dated December 22, 23, 27, 30, and 31, 1762,
and February 4, 1763, treat of the Sangley conspiracy in the province
in conjunction with the English and the Sangleys of the Pari&aacute;n
of Manila and the terrible vengeance taken. Anda informs all the
officials and people of the province of Pampanga of the discovery of
the conspiracy a few days before it was to be sprung. This was to have
been on Christmas eve, when many people would be engaged in their
devotions and others would be celebrating by becoming intoxicated. The
Chinese of the province, together with about one thousand others from
the Pari&aacute;n, were to kill right and left and thus prepare the way
for the entrance of the English. On being discovered, the Chinese make
a stand on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>the twentieth of December, but are forced to
flee refusing the promises of safety if they laid down their arms. The
officials are ordered to watch carefully and kill all the Chinese they
can find; and not allow the sale of wine. The ecclesiastics are also
warned to keep a strict watch and not to open their churches on
Christmas eve, without placing guards. The vengeance taken on the
Chinese captured is terrible, for one hundred and eighty-one of them
are killed or commit suicide, as is testified by Captain Balthasar
Casal. For the future most strict measures are to be taken in regard to
the Chinese in the province, and many restrictions are imposed upon
them, in order that they may constantly be kept under the close
surveillance of the authorities.]</p>
<p>[An edict, signed by Drake, Brook, and others, of the British
government, on January 23, 1763, offers a reward of five thousand pesos
for the capture of Anda, inasmuch as, assisted by various
ecclesiastics, he continues hostile to the British government, and is
inciting the natives of Bulacan and Pampanga provinces against it,
stipulation being made that Anda is not to be killed. Those natives who
leave Anda&rsquo;s faction will be allowed freedom of worship, and
exemption from the tribute and from personal services. The
ecclesiastics, all of whom are considered as vassals of Great Britain,
will be punished, severely if they refuse to cease their
disturbances.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3055src" href="#xd27e3055"
name="xd27e3055src">21</a>]</p>
<p>[Anda writes (probably in January or the early part of February,
1763) to the Manila cabildo and merchants, stating that he has just
heard that the archbishop is discussing with the British the sending
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>of a trading ship to Nueva Espana. Since this is
not a proper procedure, Anda considers it his duty to require a stop
put to it, and orders it to be strictly forbidden for the following
reasons: 1. The ship cannot be sent with a legitimate register, by the
English, as a state of war exists with them, nor by the archbishop, as
he is not governor. 2. Trade between England and the Philippines is
forbidden even in times of peace, as is also trade by way of the South
Sea. 3. What merchandise is taken will be that of the enemy, as the
Spanish merchants of the Philippines are in no condition to send goods,
and it is not proper to send the goods of an enemy under pretext that
they are those legitimately belonging to the city. 4. The privilege of
trade granted to Manila has ceased since Manila has passed to another
government, and cannot be regained until regulations are passed in
favor of the rest of the islands which are still loyal. 5. The word of
honor given to the British was only not to take up arms against them,
and they owe nothing else to them, and hence, can and should remain
loyal to Spain. Consequently, this effort should be resisted as
strongly as possible.]</p>
<p>[On February 12, Anda addresses a long and most bitter and
denunciatory letter to the archbishop, accusing him of connivance with
the British, and the utter disregard of Spanish interests. He reminds
the archbishop again that he has assumed the office of governor in
accordance with certain laws in the <i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>. The archbishop must cease his disloyal
practices, which are prejudicial to the rights of those domains and the
irreparable loss of the inhabitants. Through his folly, Manila was
taken by assault, and then the fort of Santiago surrendered
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>without a blow. To this is added the disastrous
sack which lasted longer than the time allowed by the rules of war;
with its accompanying evils of bloodshed, violations of the women, and
profanation of the churches. All this instead of causing the sentiment
of pity in the breast of the archbishop, has caused him to rejoice in
the success of the British. He has ceded the islands as if they were
his own property, or as if he had authority to do so, thus failing in
his oath to defend the government. The four million pesos which he has
promised, has also been in contravention of right. Both the cession and
the promise of the indemnity are null and void. The British threat to
take vengeance on the Spaniards if their demands were not met, was a
boast that would not have been carried out. The fort of Cavite could
have been defended for it was in good condition, but it was handed over
without any attempt at defense. This would have saved great trouble,
and consultation between the two crowns would have been unnecessary had
it not been done. The British now demand the cession of all the
islands, but that could have been avoided, as Anda is governor, not he.
The archbishop has been guilty of usurping a title and office that do
not belong to him, but to Anda, in view of developments at Manila. He
has endeavored to cause Anda to retire to Manila, and abandon the
defense, even sending him a passport for that purpose&mdash;a most base
attempt. He has sent orders to the alcaldes-mayor to have the
Spaniards, who have withdrawn from Manila, return thither, his object
being to have them give their word of honor to the British, a course
that will necessarily weaken the Spanish defense of the provinces. He
has secured food and supplies for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152"
href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>the British, and has induced
certain Chinese from a trading champan to settle in the Pari&aacute;n,
in order that the British may have greater strength. He has endeavored
to dislodge the Augustinians, who side with Anda,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3075src" href="#xd27e3075" name="xd27e3075src">22</a> from their
villages and supply their place with seculars. He has done these things
to curry favor with the British and through his vanity and love of
figuring. Lastly, he is attempting to have a ship sent to Nueva Espana
to trade at Acapulco. But this is clearly against all right, for the
only goods that would be sent would be English, and besides, since
Manila and Cavite are now virtually British colonies, all commerce
between them and the Spanish-American possessions is forbidden, a fact
still further enforced by the condition of war now prevailing. The
poverty of the Spaniards, with the assault and sack, does not allow
them to ship any goods at present. Anda earnestly urges the archbishop
to cease all his disloyal practices else he threatens to cry him as a
traitor to the king and an ally of the English.]</p>
<p>[The Jesuit provincial Bernardo Pazuengos,<a class="noteref" id=

Manila, asks for secret audience with Anda at Apalit, February 26. This
being granted on the afternoon of that day, no results are obtained for
the provincial can show no written credentials authorizing him as
envoy, claiming that he has been appointed and empowered only verbally,
and ordered to treat secretly with Anda. He claims not to know in what
light Anda is regarded by the British governor&mdash;whether as the
legitimate governor or as an usurper.]</p>
<p>[The archbishop writes to Anda, under date of March 21, informing
him of the arrest of Villacorta on account of his communication with
Anda (his letters having been seized), and that the sentence of death
has been passed upon him, because he has broken his word of honor.
Other Spaniards, some of them religious, have also been arrested. He
asks that the disturbances among the natives cease, and that they be
instructed in their religious duties and in loyalty, and resume their
work.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3093src" href="#xd27e3093" name=
"xd27e3093src">24</a> He writes this letter in his ecclesiastical
character in his solicitude for the souls of his flock. The archbishop
is doing his best in behalf of Villacorta.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3096src" href="#xd27e3096" name="xd27e3096src">25</a>]</p>
<p>[In answer to this letter Anda writes a long and bitter reply.
Although he says that the archbishop&rsquo;s letter merits no answer
for its lack of courtesy, yet he answers it in hopes that the
archbishop may see the error of his ways. He recalls to the
latter&rsquo;s memory that he was appointed visitor general of the
islands, with the real mission of protecting them if the English
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>captured Manila, and in case such happened, he
was to write to the bishops, prelates of the religious orders, and the
alcaldes-mayor, urging and ordering them to defend the islands and the
Catholic religion. Accordingly, he did so on the fall of Manila, and
received enthusiastic support from ecclesiastics, officials, and
natives.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3103src" href="#xd27e3103" name=
"xd27e3103src">26</a> The archbishop has, on the contrary, endeavored
to influence the prelates, religious, and natives to submit to the
British, so that one might imagine that he has lost his wits. He has
written Anda to retire to Manila and leave the government of the
provinces to the enemy, but the English will be entirely wiped out if
they do not relinquish their ideas, for they cannot settle themselves
firmly in the islands. Santiago Orendain<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3106src" href="#xd27e3106" name="xd27e3106src">27</a> as well as
the archbishop <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>has played into the hands of the British; and
because Anda has not fallen in with their ideas he has been branded as
a traitor and rebel. The archbishop has influenced the British against
Anda, and they recognizing the opportunity to create civil war in the
islands have proceeded against the latter. The British have also made
an offensive and defensive alliance with the king of
Jol&oacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3116src" href="#xd27e3116"
name="xd27e3116src">28</a> but the archbishop has offered no serious
objection to such a procedure, which is to make war upon the Catholic
religion, for it will inundate the islands with Mahometans, in addition
to the English Protestants. This is opposed to the treaty between the
Joloans and Spaniards, as well as to the agreements made between the
English and Spaniards. The English answer the archbishop&rsquo;s letter
of protest of such an alliance by saying that the Spaniards have failed
to keep their promise; whereat the archbishop, instead of declaring a
holy war, and calling on the people to defend their religion with their
lives, accepts the situation. The English have profaned the churches,
but the archbishop has done nothing. The manner in which the archbishop
protected the notorious criminal Orendain in the meeting of the
Audiencia, when his violent language attracted the attention of
citizens, left much room for doubt as to his sanity. Anda continues as
follows <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>with a harsh attack on the archbishop, which
although possibly too violent, throws much light on the life of the
times:]</p>
<p>The memory of that letter, which your Excellency wrote to the bishop
of Zeb&ugrave;, when the latter was president, governor, and
captain-general of these islands, does not fail to corroborate this
idea [<i>i.e.</i>, of the archbishop&rsquo;s sanity]. In that letter
you advised him that in order that you might undertake to consecrate
him, he must first assure your Excellency, among other things, that he
would not hold dances of women and men in the palace, as that was
entirely opposed to modesty, prudence, and a delicate conscience of
bishops, as well as outside the object of the consecration. That advice
was very worthy of praise, although it would appear that it was idle
and could have been excused because of the solid virtue and religious
conduct of Se&ntilde;or Espeleta. But (oh human misery and weakness!)
your Excellency did not practice that healthful counsel in the
celebration of the patronage of our Lady of Guadalupe. For, to the
universal confusion and laughter of all your flock, and of the respect
due to your exalted dignity, your Excellency invited to your palace,
all the ladies of distinction and the women of the lower class, in
order that they might celebrate said festivity with contradances,
fandangos, and other dances, which lasted on different nights from six
in the evening until one or two in the morning; and those ladies made
use of your Excellency&rsquo;s privy and bedroom for that indecent
although natural easing of the body. Neither was your Excellency
dissuaded by the consideration that during the carnival days of the
year 1762, you preached, as a good shepherd and vigilant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>prelate, against dancing, portraying with just
arguments the spiritual risks and ruin which followed from it and
especially from those dances in which the dancers hold one
anothers&rsquo; hands and clasp arms, as well as from those which
caused some immodest movements; and yet, it was public and notorious
that on the night preceding said sermon and on the following night,
your Excellency had in your palace the greatest concourse of men and
women of all classes ever seen in Manila, and the same women whom your
Excellency chid in the pulpit, and [whose procedure you] considered as
an action very near to spiritual ruin, were incessantly engaged in
dancing. It is worth noting that some ladies excused themselves from
attending said party, and you expressed your indignation, saying that
you would compel them to attend such functions. Equally, or much more,
is this idea confirmed by the reflection of what happened in Cavite, on
the occasion of your Excellency having gone to inspect the keel of a
ship which was to be constructed; for under this pretext, your
Excellency invited and even compelled many ladies of Manila to go to
said port, where, and on distinct nights, your Excellency made the
round of the village amid fine music and ladies, inciting the latter to
sing the <i>Chairo</i>, the <i>Forito</i>, and other profane songs,
interpolating them with the most holy rosary which was recited in the
church, and after the round, the abovesaid dances were held at your
Excellency&rsquo;s lodging, and you presided at all parts of it,
inciting them like the worst pander and dancing director. Thus, your
Excellency, not only were some of the ladies ashamed of your excesses,
but it is also apparent to me that the ecclesiastics&mdash;seculars and
regulars&mdash;of said port <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href=
"#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>were scandalized, and entirely
trustworthy and prudent persons assert that the repair of the spiritual
damage which you caused by your bad example would cost great labor; and
if the mention of it to you by your subjects can avail for your
conversion and repentance, I am ready to do it, for the sake of your
soul. What shall I say, then, of what happened in your
Excellency&rsquo;s apartments in the hamlet of Nagtaja, where for the
space of all one summer, of last year, there was no let up of music and
dancing until daybreak, and banquets of men and women, that in order
that the latter might take their siestas, they made use of your
Excellency&rsquo;s apartments, obliging you to leave them, although not
to so great a distance that they did not discommode you? And it is
quite worth noting that at the same time that your Excellency was
occupied and dazzled in these festivities, so opposed to your character
[of your office], the English were planning the conquest of Manila, and
with it the ruin of all the islands. Consider, now, your Excellency, in
view of the above, whether such procedures and conduct in a prelate, of
the truth of which there cannot be the slightest doubt, are those of
one who is in the possession of his right senses.</p>
<p>[The archbishop&rsquo;s letters have no effect and fail of their
purpose when events prove that he does quite the contrary to what he
writes and preaches and counsels. Experience shows that he is making
use of apparently virtuous means to deliver the islands over to
Calvinism and Lutheranism; and that would inevitably have happened had
not Anda instituted a vigorous defense, aided by the bishops and other
pious and loyal Spaniards and natives, all of whom recognize the
legitimacy of his government and deny <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>all the authority of
the archbishop and Orendain. Anda is sorry for the plight in which
Villacorta is, and would aid him if he could, but if such aid must be
at the expense of the islands, then he will not move in his
defense&mdash;which he would not do for anyone, not even his own
parents. He will take full vengeance for it later. However, he believes
that the English are but making use of the archbishop in order to
secure a suspension of hostilities. Besides, he can do nothing toward
bringing about peace if he is a declared traitor and rebel, and even if
the enemy recognize him as true governor, he cannot have anything to do
with such proposals unless they are made to him in writing and in due
form. This matter of Villacorta is only a pretext to make Anda hated by
the people, and a scheme by which the English can gain possession of
the provinces. In all their machinations they have made use of the
archbishop to aid them to gain their ends. When the fort of Santiago
was surrendered to the British, a verbal agreement was made with
General Draper by the archbishop &ldquo;that the persons, wealth, and
possessions of all the persons in said fort were to be free, as were
also the wealth and possessions of those in the city, with the sole
difference that the latter were to be prisoners; that the practice of
religion and the exercise of its tribunals were also to continue in the
same manner as before the capture of the city, commerce also being
free, etc.&rdquo; The British have, however, not kept this agreement,
and the archbishop justly treated them at that time as robbers and
pirates. But if that was so in October how can the archbishop now aid
or abet them in the ruin of the islands, and draining the treasury,
city, churches, and pious funds, besides giving <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>warrants for two million pesos on the
king&mdash;and all this without any opposition. With the sack and the
capture of the &ldquo;Santisima Trinidad,&rdquo; a sum greater than the
four million pesos unjustly demanded has been raised. How can they
expect Villacorta to keep his word of honor, which it was unnecessary
for him to give as he was in the fort? If he gave such word it was
under compulsion. All this should be represented by the archbishop to
the judges who condemned Villacorta. Anda earnestly entreats the latter
to reform in his manner of living, and to cease his excesses.<a class=

<p>My Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Yesterday the governor handed me the letter which your Grace was
pleased to send him, in which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>your Grace promises to be
loyal to his sacred Majesty, the king of Gran Breta&ntilde;a, my
master. You may believe, Don Diego, that your letter gave me especial
pleasure and great joy&mdash;so much so that I resolved to send you one
of his Majesty&rsquo;s ships under my command, in order to assure your
Grace of my protection, and aid in the name of my master, against the
common enemy, Espa&ntilde;a. I have been very sensible of the many
injuries which your Grace has suffered under the tyrannical government
of the Spaniards; but 1 am very pleased to know that your Grace has
opened your eyes, and that your Grace will strengthen and encourage
your people to humiliate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href=
"#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>the sovereignty of so cruel a
nation. For motives of this nature, the king my master drew his sword
in defense of his vassals, and of other nations, his allies, who
suffered the lash of the Spanish tyranny in different parts of the
world. Your Grace can rest assured of the consideration of the king my
master, when he learns of your Grace&rsquo;s loyalty and the injuries
which your Grace and good compatriots have suffered from the hand of
the one by whom you ought to have been protected and aided, from the
general whom his Majesty despatched, together with the admiral. On the
general&rsquo;s return he will give information of the conquest of
these islands, and is well instructed to represent to his Majesty the
completely favorable attitude of the natives of them.</p>
<p>The admiral went with the greater part of the squadron to protect
the dominions along the coast and Yndia. He has left me particular
instructions to cultivate harmonious relations and friendship with the
province of Ylocos and the other nations of the north. I am sorry that
I have not paid your Grace a visit, but important business has
prevented me. However, your Grace can rest assured that I shall be most
vigilant in extending help to you.</p>
<p>In a short time, your Grace will have troops and war supplies. This
despatch is to assure your Grace of our friendship and my satisfaction
at receiving your letter, and because of your loyalty. In order that
your Grace may communicate it to all the people, especially to those
under your command, I am sending your Grace a small bronze cannon in
token of affection.</p>
<p>I hope that the provinces of Pangazinan and Cagayan will soon follow
your worthy example and tear off the chains of Spanish slavery.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>I am also sending your Grace the edict published by the two leaders
of sea and land, when we conquered our enemy. For my part I assure you
that I shall religiously observe it, and I invite you when time
permits, to despatch your boats to this capital, where they will be
welcomed for their trade. The bearer of this letter is a captain in his
Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s service, and he will inform your Grace of
particulars. Hence, I shall not go to great length to repeat, with my
accustomed sincerity, that I shall employ all my strength in your
defense, in order that your Grace may free yourself from the Spanish
yoke. I shall not cease to beseech God, our Lord, to preserve your
Grace for many years. Manila, May 6, 1763.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>[<i>Addressed</i>: &ldquo;To Don Diego Silang, alcalde-mayor and
war-captain for his Majesty in the province of Ylocos.&rdquo;]</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>[Under date of March (<i>sic in original</i>; May?) 15, the British
commander of the forces in Manila, Roberto Eduardo Fell, writes Anda,
asking him to see to it that acts of barbarism and cruelty such as have
been practiced by Anda&rsquo;s troops against the British, on many
occasions, be discontinued. He denies that the British soldiers have
broken the laws of warfare, and during the sack, many officers tried to
restrain them at the risk of their own lives, while the Spanish troops
have on the contrary fired more than once at the white flag, thus not
adhering to the honorable conduct of Spaniards in Europe. He does not
ask for discontinuance of the war, but only observance of the common
humanities of war.]</p>
<p>[Anda answers the preceding letter on the twenty-first of May, in
which he deals at length with the charges of inhumanity and cruelty
made against the Spaniards by Fell, and in sarcastic terms makes
counter charges of cruelty and lack of good faith on the part of the
English. &ldquo;Manila,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was lost, because it was
poorly defended, the citadel because it was basely surrendered, as was
also the port of Cavite; and not because there was a lack of brave
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>Spaniards, but because they had the misfortune
not to have a leader to manage them, with less ignominy, disorder, and
confused foresight, than those displayed by the archbishop.&rdquo;
After the English entered by assault, they committed many acts of
cruelty, killing often without quarter. The English have not always
respected the white flag, and have used it for unlawful purposes, such
as sending an officer into the Spanish camp to offer amnesty and pardon
to deserters if they would return to their companies. When Anda was as
yet without troops or weapons, the English proscribed him as a traitor,
and put a price on his capture, alive or dead. Since the English have
acted thus inhumanely toward him, is Anda obliged to regard the laws of
warfare? Anda refers to a British edict of May 17 which he says appears
to be in the same hand as the letter received from Fell. Such a thing
does not argue for the good faith of the English.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3224src" href="#xd27e3224" name="xd27e3224src">32</a> Anda denies
in heated terms charges of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>personal cruelty and encouragement
of inhumanity and cruelty. He has used his efforts to restrain his men,
especially the natives who are barbarously inclined. He has even
offered a reward of five hundred pesos for each English officer
captured alive and brought in living.]</p>
<p>[A manifesto or edict published by the British government in Manila
under date of June 6, and sent to Anda, &ldquo;former auditor of the
royal Audiencia and supposed governor of the Filipinas Islands,&rdquo;
threshes the whole matter over again. The acts of the British are
carefully excused of all cruelty, while on the other hand, the
inhumanity and cruelty of Anda and his troops are proved clearly to the
satisfaction of the English. The latter are called pirates and robbers
by Anda, but the term is misapplied; for the British did not take a
just vengeance for the death of one of their officers who was killed
under the white flag. Anda has been, and is, a rebel to the king of
Spain, for he has not regarded the commands of the archbishop, the
rightly constituted Spanish representative of Spanish sovereignty. The
archbishop has never made public the commission with which Anda claims
that he left the city. What more are Anda&rsquo;s men than canaille (a
name to which Anda objects), for they are rebels to the proper
authority, and are made up of vagabond Indians, robbers, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>murderers, and some few deserters who are
captained by some irreligious friars, and some persons who broke their
word of honor not to take up arms against the British? Anda has not
scrupled to reward murderers by political offices and money. The
British manifesto offers five thousand pesos for the capture of Anda,
but stipulates that he is to be kept alive. Anda is trying to seduce
the natives and set them against peace and order. If his armed bands
continue, it will result in the shedding of much blood and in the
destruction of the country, for Anda can never drive out and defeat the
English, and reconquer Manila. Even if the city is returned to the
Spaniards, it must either be left to the natives or reconquered from
them by the Spanish king. Auditor Galban, the fiscal, Leandro Viana,
and the marquis of Monte Castro, and many others, have broken their
word of honor and have gone over to Anda. This is a violation of a most
sacred oath. It cannot be excused by saying that the British have
broken their promises, for their promises had nothing to do with the
word of honor given by the Spanish prisoners of war. Anda is breaking
the rights of nations by receiving and welcoming such violators of
their word. Even Villacorta, the only auditor who remains in the city,
has long been holding traitorous communications with the
rebels.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3235src" href="#xd27e3235" name=
"xd27e3235src">33</a> In spite of all <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>these things, and the
non-fulfilment of the Spaniards to pay the two million pesos in cash of
the four settled upon for their ransom (failing even to pay the one
million which the British consented to take in cash, because the
Spaniards have not given as freely as they can), the British have ever
treated them with the honor characteristic of the English nation. The
peace of the islands has been prevented by the conduct of the
Spaniards.]</p>
<p>[Letters from Anda to Bishop Bernardo Ustariz and the people of the
province of Ilocos in general, respectively dated June 13, and 12,
return thanks for the victory over the insurgent Silang, and mention
the celebrations with solemn mass that have been held in Bacolor. The
indult issued by the bishop to the Ilocans is approved. Pedro Bicbic,
the chief justice, and Miguel Vicos, are especially thanked for their
part in the victory and remuneration will be made to them. For the
present, the bishop is to have charge of civil affairs in the province.
The arms taken from Silang and distributed by the bishop to the loyal
Ilocans are given them as their own; and report is to be made the king,
so that he may fittingly reward them.]</p>
<p>[Anda writes to the archbishop under date of July 29, refusing to
assent to the truce offered by the latter between Anda and the British,
and which the archbishop declares to have been arranged for between the
sovereigns. Anda demands that communications of such a nature must be
made him directly by the British authorities and not through the
archbishop, whom he cannot trust, and who is, besides, a prisoner.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>Indeed, the archbishop has no business to meddle
with the matter at all. Anda distrusts the sincerity of the British,
and suspects some plot to invade his territory. The archbishop should
be mindful of the verbal agreement which he himself made with General
Draper when he surrendered the fort of Santiago, and how it was
completely disregarded. Anda insists on official recognition and the
drawing up of documents that can be used as proof of any negotiations
entered into between himself and the British.]</p>
<p>[The British in Manila publish an edict on September 19, declaring
Anda responsible for any further bloodshed because of his disregard of
the news of the suspension of hostilities, as arranged between the
deputies of the two sovereigns. The first news of the suspension was
brought by a ship from Madras on July 23, 1763, and was sent forthwith
to Anda by the archbishop. The preliminaries of peace, signed by each
side, were brought from the same port on August 26. But although Anda
was also informed of this immediately, he has paid no attention to it,
and has steadfastly dared to violate the orders of his sovereign.
Hence, if he does not acquiesce in the suspension, he, or any of his
adherents, will be attacked, wherever met, with arms; and at the first
opportunity, information regarding his obstinacy and arrogancy will be
sent to Spain.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3250src" href="#xd27e3250"
name="xd27e3250src">34</a>]</p>
<p>[In regard to the alleged suspension of hostilities by the British,
Anda issues two edicts or proclamations, dated September 28, and
October 24, respectively. He complains that he has not been treated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>by the invaders as rightful governor, and that
no legitimate messages have been transmitted to him. The attempt of the
British is to inflame the natives against him by a system of trickery.
To publish a suspension of hostilities, and then to commit all sorts of
excesses (as the English have done) is hardly sincere. Anda issues
these proclamations in order that the people may not be deceived by the
trickery and double-dealing of the enemy.]</p>
<p>[The wrongs inflicted by the English, in which are included excesses
and outrages of all sorts, form the subject of Anda&rsquo;s letter of
November 2, to Thomas Becus [Backhouse], commander-in-chief of the
British forces. Several instances of the cruelty of the soldiers are
mentioned, especially those in which no quarter has been shown to
Spaniards who have surrendered. Although the British have published a
suspension of hostilities they have continued to commit all manner of
outrages, such as robbery, arson, bribery, etc., and Anda has been
informed of this suspension only extra-officially. The cannons and war
supplies of Manila and Cavite have been despoiled unlawfully, for these
places are held by the British forces only for the time being and all
their effects are on deposit.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3260src" href=
"#xd27e3260" name="xd27e3260src">35</a> Anda asks Becus to use his
influence in restraining these outrages, and to urge the matter
properly with his government. He protests against the payment of
salaries on the Spanish royal account <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>by the British for
such expenses have been met from the situado annually sent to the
islands; and some that have been paid are unauthorized. His last
proclamation is enclosed, and the British are asked to act honorably
and cease all excesses. Especially do the Spanish loyalists wish to
have the British officer Slay<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3265src" href=
"#xd27e3265" name="xd27e3265src">36</a> delivered to them for proper
punishment, for he has been most guilty and brutal in his overstepping
of civilized warfare.]</p>
<p>[In his reply to the preceding letter (November 22), the English
commandant shows himself to be more of a diplomat than Major Fell. He
writes in a conciliatory, yet firm tone, and in a far different spirit
than former English letters. He insists that justice has been the
keynote of the English government since he has taken command of its
forces during the past month. Had he commanded in place of Major Fell
(whom he does not like), and had any outrages been committed by his
soldiers, they would have been punished. He is opposed to war, but
recognizes therein, his responsibility for his own orders. Only after
receiving Anda&rsquo;s letter has he learned that the cannon and
supplies of Manila have been removed and carried to Madras. They will
be replaced, if an order to that effect is received from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>the
king. Anda&rsquo;s complaints would have had more weight had he
consented to observe the truce arranged between the two sovereigns; but
his threats of vengeance are not quite in good point, especially since
the truth that the treaty has been ratified is proved. Becus deprecates
the possibility of civil war between the factions of the archbishop and
Anda. It would be better for all to join forces and improve the
condition of the country. The British troops will soon leave Manila,
and it will be wise for all to avoid civil war. The outrages committed
in Santa Cruz and in its environs were by bands of ladrones who called
themselves Anda&rsquo;s men.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3275src" href=
"#xd27e3275" name="xd27e3275src">37</a> They have committed wanton
destruction of property, and have been guilty of torture and murder. He
justifies his sending military detachments outside Manila for food
supplies, as self preservation is the first requisite the world over.
The rupees, some of which have been put into circulation, are of more
value than the peso, and of better quality, and there is no need to
withdraw them. There has been no false coinage except by some Chinese
who have been hanged. He challenges Anda to prove that bribery and
corruption are common, and that he has refused justice to Spaniard or
native. He would be glad of an interview with Anda.]</p>
<p>[Anda replies in a short paper of January 23, 1764, to the
preliminaries of peace submitted to him by the British commandant. He
outlines his position, and his right to the title of governor and
captain-general, and presents objections to some of the articles.]
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span></p>
<p>[An edict published by Anda, January 24, 1764, states that when the
British give truthful declaration that they will abide exactly by
articles 21 and 22 of the peace preliminaries that have been signed
between the English and Spanish, and which relate to the evacuation of
the places occupied by the former, then hostilities will cease, and the
British will be given all necessary help in their transportation. But
until such time, the war will continue.]</p>
<p>[Anda writes a letter to the English governor Drake, in which he
indignantly refuses to believe the assurances of the latter as to his
humane proceedings, and accuses him of citing instances of cruelty to
Spaniards and natives, profanation of churches, and other atrocities.
He knows this because he has seen it himself in the provinces where he
has been. Drake&rsquo;s actions, leveled also against those of his own
nation, who would have been humane and obedient to the orders of their
sovereign, are those of a pirate and traitor, and such as befit
barbarians.]</p>
<p>[In a note addressed to the British military and civil chiefs of
Manila, January 28, Anda cites two clauses of the treaty of February
10, 1763, made between the English and Spanish. Article 22 provides:
&ldquo;that all the countries and territories that might have been
gained by conquest in any part of the world, either by the arms of his
Britannic and most faithful Majesty, or by those of his most Christian
and Catholic Majesty, which are not comprehended in the present
articles, article of cession, or article of restitution, shall be
returned without raising any difficulty, and without asking
compensation.&rdquo; Article 22 provided that restitution and

declares Anda, was in August, 1763, yet the British still hold Manila
and Cavite, and if they do not leave in the next month, they must
remain until the monsoon of 1765. He earnestly asks that the terms of
the treaty be observed, and all hostilities suspended. In such case,
the British will be furnished with food and all necessary supplies at a
just price; otherwise hostilities will continue. A vigorous protest is
made of all the damage occasioned by Silang and other insurgents in the
provinces who have been aided by the British. Following this note, Anda
addresses another to the same officials February 3, citing article I of
the peace preliminaries, to the effect that orders will be sent to the
three powers to suspend hostilities, and that passports will be given
to the ships of the three powers that are to be despatched to bear the
news of the treaties of the three powers. But since such orders have
not been received by the royal Audiencia, they have no authority to
cease the war unless the British agree to certain proposals of the
royal Audiencia.]</p>

addressed by his proper titles in full),<a class="noteref" id=

holding them until receiving the copy of the treaty above-mentioned.
These agents will have power to treat on all matters. Anda would go
himself, but necessary business renders it impossible. On the tenth,
Anda writes again to the effect that he will facilitate the furnishing
of supplies to the British as far as possible. He will appoint persons
to arrange details of the delivery of Manila and Cavite, though the
delivery itself is to be made to the troops in military style.<a class=

enemy. In the summary exposition which was sent to the pope regarding
this matter, it was shown that they preached against the government,
and that their provincial had illicit relations with Draper during the
occupancy of Manila. This was partly the reason for their expulsion by
C&aacute;rlos III. In the archives at Simancas, legajo 288 of

as traitors for their action during the war with the British. See

will not permit us to give <i lang="la">in extenso</i> an account of
the insurrection headed by Diego Sil&aacute;n or Silang. It was the
most obstinate of all the insurrections that broke out against the
Spaniards during the English occupation. Diego Sil&aacute;n was born
December 16, 1730, in Pangasinan province. As a lad he served the cura
of Vigan, but being sent down to Manila, the boat in which he took
passage was wrecked on the coast of Bolinao. All his companions were
killed by the barbarous inhabitants, but he was kept as a slave, being
finally ransomed by a Recollect friar. Later he became a messenger for
the parish priest at Vigan, and being found trustworthy was appointed
to carry the letters to Manila annually at the time the Manila boat was
expected. In this service, he acquired a wide acquaintance; and it was
comparatively easy for him after the assault of Manila to rouse the
natives, under pretext of protecting themselves from the British since
the Spaniards were no longer able to defend them. Demands formulated
and presented by the insurgents include the deposition of the
alcalde-mayor, Antonio Zabala; that office to be held by the provisor
Tom&aacute;s Mill&aacute;n; the election of one of the four chiefs of
Vigan as justice; the expulsion of all the Spaniards and mestizos from
the province; the appointment of Sil&aacute;n to make head against the
English. The insurrection makes great headway, and is soon found to be
an attempt to break with all Spanish authority, and the insurgents are
incited by the British, who appoint Sil&aacute;n alcalde and governor
of the province of Ilocos. Sil&aacute;n meddles with ecclesiastical
matters, opposing Bishop Ustariz, whereupon the latter pronounces an
interdict in Vigan. Augustinians seized by Sil&aacute;n are imprisoned
three separate times. Sil&aacute;n is finally killed by a Spanish
mestizo, Miguel Vicos, May 28, 1763. This insurrection was quickly put
down after the death of Sil&aacute;n, who was its life and exhibited a
certain amount of shrewdness and resource. But shortly after, another
insurrection was started under Sil&aacute;n&rsquo;s uncle,
Nicol&aacute;s Cari&ntilde;o, which gained considerable headway,
although it was finally stifled and quiet restored. Anda took various
measures against these insurrections, but it was impossible for him to
leave his post in Bulacan, where English matters occupied his
attention. These insurrections were perhaps the most serious that the

and Cornish sent an edict to the Filipinos on September 24, 1762,
announcing that the Filipinos need have no fear of the British fleet,
provided that they do not join the Spaniards or assist them in any way.
They will be received under British protection; their women and
children will be free from outrages; full prices will be paid them for
food; they will be free to go and come as they please; and freedom of
worship will be conserved to them. If they do, on the contrary, aid the
Spanish, then they must fear the punishment that will be inflicted. May
13, 1763, Silang writes the British assuring them of obedience and
non-aid to the Spaniards. In the same month, the British write Silang
promising to send him soon, troops, weapons, and war supplies. The
British successes in Manila, Pasig, and Maysilo, are mentioned, while
in the month just past, the fort of Batangas in Bulacan has been
captured. They are attracting all the natives of the islands to their
banners, and have treated them humanely, freeing them from the tribute
and the various ecclesiastical oppressions. The Augustinians have been
especially active against the British, and against the vows of their
profession have taken up arms, thus occasioning the shedding of much
blood. They have also treated Silang cruelly. Therefore the British
will esteem it if Silang will secure the Augustinians, the alcalde,
Antonio Zavala, and all other Spaniards, and send the same to the
English, taking possession besides of all their property and estates.
The lack of priests for the present may be filled by seculars until the
archbishop can appoint others. The British wish to conserve the
Catholic religion. No duties shall be charged on their trading boats.
The provinces of Pangasinan and Cagayan will also be admitted under the
protection of the British, if they desire it. Silang&rsquo;s aid is
asked against Anda and his men. With the letter are sent copies of a
manifesto inviting trade. (All these documents are contained in the
manuscript entitled <i lang="es">Ingleses en

edict is as follows: &ldquo;Inasmuch as many malcontents of the
district of Se&ntilde;or Anda frequently come to the villages of Santa
Cruz, Binondoc, etc., for the purpose of killing the officers and
soldiers whom they meet; and since said malcontents flee precipitously
as soon as our troops go out in pursuit of them: therefore, notice is
given to all the Spaniards living in said villages, to come to live
within the city of Manila inside of one week, since we can protect them
in this way. If, perchance, they neglect to obey this order, they must
stand the consequences, for if many of said canaille gather together,
it is feasible that the governor will be necessarily obliged to order
the cannon fired among the houses, for the purpose of driving them
away.&rdquo; (Published in Malo de Luque, v, pp. 284&ndash;285; Mas, i,
p. 183; and Montero y Vidal, ii, pp. 602, 603). This edict Anda
answered on the nineteenth at Bacolor. In it the British are styled as
dishonorable men, for regarding as rebels those who are loyal to their
king, and for their offer of a reward for Anda alive or dead. The
statements in the edict of the seventeenth, namely, that the loyalist
Spanish troops are canaille and that they are on the lookout for
opportunity to murder British officers, are branded as utter
falsehoods. In return, the three men who have signed the above
edict&mdash;Drake, Smith, and Brook&mdash;are proscribed, and a price
of ten thousand pesos offered for each one, dead or alive. This edict
further orders that the humane treatment of the Spanish toward English
captives or deserters be continued as hitherto, to the extent possible.

edict, which is given entire by Malo de Luque, v, pp. 285&ndash;290;

28, 1763, the fiscal Viana fled the city, going to Anda&rsquo;s camp,
where he was gladly received, and where he became very useful. Later
Villacorta also escaped to Anda&rsquo;s camp. The latter and
Galb&aacute;n, who had been very far from doing their duty in the time
of danger, conspired to wrest the command from Anda in case of
Rojo&rsquo;s death, on the grounds that most persons believed that the
government of the islands should be given to Bishop Ust&aacute;riz of
Nueva Segovia. The Franciscan and Recollect provincials, and the Jesuit
superior declared that the command belonged to Anda; while the other
religious institutes were neutral or sided with Bishop Ust&aacute;riz.
The Augustinians pronounced for Villacorta. See Montero y Vidal, ii,

an eighteenth-century date upon them, that were turned up by the

Spaniards, and about five thousand natives, as well as by Busto.
Finally, the English took the convent and killed the alcalde-mayor, and
some Recollects and other Spaniards. Some of the wounded took refuge in
a garret of the convent, but were captured and handed over by Slay to
the Sangleys, who killed them after inflicting severe tortures. Only

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Relation of the operations of the archbishop of
Manila, governor and captain-general of the Philipinas, during the time
of his government, of the measures taken during the time of the siege
or blockade by the English of the capital of Manila, of its capture by
assault, of the events which followed this unfortunate occurrence.
Written for the defense of his fame and name which were abused and
trampled under foot by envy through its calumnies, injuries, and
reproaches by word and writing in letters and great libels.</i></p>
<p>[The archbishop<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3335src" href=
"#xd27e3335" name="xd27e3335src">1</a> begins his relation with a short
introduction, in which he states that his defense <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>against the libels that have been published
against him will consist of a synopsis or summary of his deeds while
archbishop and governor, and of events during the English siege and
invasion. He considers the libels themselves as unworthy an answer in
kind and hence will not satisfy an idle curiosity to such an extent;
and even if the charges made against him were true, to defend himself
so, would only increase the scandal. He is answerable for his errors,
not to the ignorant crowd, but to his king, and to the learned and
prudent men of the Spanish nation.]</p>
<p><i>Part first. Of the operations of the archbishop during the time
of his government of the islands.</i></p>
<p>[The archbishop finds it necessary to refer to the events of this
period as some of them are connected with the events of the two
following periods; and because complaints have been made of him. The
first thing noted is the peace that the archbishop brought about in the
ranks of the Augustinians who had split up into various factions, and
who had sought the aid of the law. He also heals the breach between the
visitor and the provincial of the Recollects, first succeeding in
getting a peaceful entry for the visitor. One of the matters under the
latter&rsquo;s jurisdiction having been settled in favor of the
defendant, a religious, whom the order had condemned and deprived of
honor, the breach opens again, but is finally settled by a council of
Dominican and Augustinian religious, the visitor, the provincial and
definitors of the Recollects. By the ship &ldquo;Philipino,&rdquo; the
archbishop asks the viceroy of Mexico for one hundred soldiers, but
asks him not to send criminals or evil-minded men. He asks also that
fifty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>thousand pesos of the annual situado be in small
change in order to replace the clipped coin in circulation and also to
prevent further counterfeiting, which is so widespread. He also turns
his attention to the troops, appointing officers and opening a
recruiting station. He sends one hundred soldiers to Zamboanga, as well
as the annual supplies, including two thousand pesos extra. Eighty
soldiers are sent to the province of Caraga which has been ravaged by
the Moros of late. These are in command of Nicolas Norton,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3351src" href="#xd27e3351" name="xd27e3351src">2</a>
an Englishman, who has become a naturalized Spaniard. The latter is
commissioned to cultivate spice and cinnamon, the working of which he
understands thoroughly. With him goes a Recollect missionary to attend
to spiritual matters, and good results are promised to Christianity.
The new bishop of Zeb&ugrave; is despatched to his diocese, taking with
him six thousand pesos of the funds of that bishopric, which has been
adjudged him by the Audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3357src"
href="#xd27e3357" name="xd27e3357src">3</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>The
archbishop has a part in the pacification of Bohol through the above
bishop and the alcalde-mayor newly appointed to that province.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3370src" href="#xd27e3370" name="xd27e3370src">4</a>
They succeed in reducing the chief insurgent Dagahoy and three thousand
men, after the province had been in rebellion for over fourteen years,
during which two Jesuits have been killed. &ldquo;At the beginning of
the archbishop&rsquo;s term of government, a contagious epidemic of
smallpox showed and declared itself, which had stealthily and slowly
gained a foothold in the city and spread rapidly through the villages
in its environs, without escaping little or big of the very great
population of the natives.&rdquo; The archbishop meets the issue by
various spiritual and temporal measures, detailing ecclesiastical
ministers to administer the sacraments, in which both regulars and
Jesuits aid manfully. &ldquo;A holy field was assigned for burials,
because of the horror caused by the dead in the churches, and to
prevent the pest from spreading because of the stench. He appointed
four deputies from the regidors, and a like number from the
ecclesiastical cabildo with instructions and orders which he gave to
attend to all the necessities of the poor and sick.&rdquo; He gives
these men one thousand pesos of his own income, and various sums
resulting from fines, especially from play (more than two thousand
pesos) for the charitable work. A council of physicians is called to
write a prescription which is posted up in all the churches of the
villages and in other public places. The archbishop keeps a sharp eye
on temporal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>and spiritual matters, during the entire time of
the epidemic. The general calamity is still further heightened by a
violent typhoon which occurs on October 12 of this year, when the
epidemic is at its worst. Relief to both is accorded through the many
supplications made to heaven. The epidemic spreading through the
provinces, the measures for spiritual and temporal relief are extended
thither. In the middle of the month of December the archbishop begins
to suffer from a disease of the eyes which lasts for more than two
months, which obliges him to use a signet seal instead of writing his
name, in order that the business of the country might not cease.
January 20, the anniversary of the birth of the king is held with great
solemnity, and despite his affliction, the archbishop fulfils his share
in the ceremonial celebrations. It is learned that Auditor Francisco
Villacorta has not been present at the celebration because his carriage
has been detained at the palace-door leading to the living apartments
of the governor, and where the archbishop-governor has prohibited
entrance on account of his illness, the Audiencia using the other or
general door. As punishment for his non-attendance he is ordered to
remain a prisoner in his house and threatened with a fine. This gives
occasion for a breach between the official and the archbishop-governor.
In the following month are held the celebrations in honor of our Lady
of Guadalupe, the ceremonies being both ecclesiastical and
social.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3379src" href="#xd27e3379" name=
"xd27e3379src">5</a> Among the latter are three afternoons given up to
bullfights, &ldquo;which was properly an entertainment, without any
fear of danger, for the bulls hereabout are not courageous and fierce
like those of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>both Espa&ntilde;as,&rdquo; and anyone could
indulge in the sport, even the unskilled. There are also musical
entertainments and dancing which are designed chiefly for the ladies.
The illness of the archbishop, however, compels him to hold aloof from
the celebration. During Lent and the three days of jubilee in honor of
the coronation of the pope, the proper ceremonies are observed, but the
archbishop&rsquo;s illness allows him to take but little part in
them.]</p>
<p>16. Since the archbishop assumed the responsibility, at the
beginning of his government, of the many measures which were necessary
for the fulfilment of that post, among various others to which he
attended, he set his gaze and hand to the navy which was both in a
backward state and important. He immediately endeavored to get boats,
and was able to purchase three galleys&mdash;one a large one, and two
small&mdash;and two champans. He gave order and money to the new
alcalde-mayor of Pangasinan for two galleys and two champans; to the
alcalde-mayor of Sorsogon for two more galleys, and sent him a
shipbuilder; to the alcalde-mayor of Orani and Zambales order and money
for a like number of the above-mentioned boats. Since he also had an
order from his Majesty to construct two fragatas of fifty cannons, this
was the chief thing to which he turned his attention. Having been
informed of the great amount of wood which had been collected for this
purpose by Mariscal Arandia, in the two cuttings which he had ordered
in various places, and that said wood was for the most part used, and
that at the moment of the conclusion of his government, his successor
had had the cutting stopped, the archbishop again established them, in
the districts which were found to be most <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>suitable.
Consequently, methodically and economically, the necessary timber was
collected for a fragata, and the speedy sending of a like amount or
more for the other fragata.</p>
<p>[All the preparations having been made, the work is started in the
shipyards at Cavite, whither the archbishop goes in person. In that
city he is royally entertained by the castellan of the fort, two
bullfights being arranged for him, and musical concerts being given
nightly during the five or six days of his stay there. The archbishop
while there spends his time as follows: in the morning he celebrates
mass, and goes to others attended by his suite, among whom are Manuel
Galban, the auditor, and Francisco Viana, the fiscal; visits the royal
storehouses, and the walls which are being repaired; during the
remainder of the afternoon, if there is time, he visits the environs of
the village; and at the time of the Angelus goes to the church where
there is music. Thence, preceded by the musicians, he goes to his
apartments where he listens to a concert until nine, at which hour he
sups. Many complaints are made of this, as well as of the festivities
in the palace at Manila and the time which he spends in his summer
residence of Nagtahan, where he passes the hot months, namely, April,
May, and a part of June. By his efforts to construct a navy, the
archbishop believes that he is doing his duty. He plans to restrain the
Moros from their raids, and has the coasts of the Visayan Islands
guarded.]</p>

<p>19. &hellip; But the embassy of the sultan of Mindanao happening to
come almost at the same time as that of Ba[n]tilan, who is governing
the islands of the sultan of Jolo,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3405src"
href="#xd27e3405" name="xd27e3405src">6</a> both with propositions
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>of peace, and of valuable conditions, it was
becoming very apparent that many advantages would accrue to our side,
and the hostility of the Moros be kept in check.</p>
<p>20. In regard to what was advised and ordered by his Majesty, the
archbishop received these two embassies, and that from Jolo, with the
previous consent and pleasure of the king of said island, Don Fernando
I, who was greatly obliged by this attention, as well as by others
which the archbishop had observed toward him. For the archbishop had
given him a house and a carriage within the city, and had taken him
from the most unworthy lodgings where he lived in the royal fort,
because of having recognized the need of repairing it and having begun
said work.</p>
<p>21. The ambassador or envoy from Bantilan incited said Don Fernando
to petition and repeat his writings to the archbishop, so that his
cause which had been so long delayed might be reviewed. This cause was
so foggy and laden with many knotty and ancient points which having
been examined and an extract having been made in regard to the whole
matter, the archbishop sent it for a consultative vote to the royal
assembly and in view of what the assembly stated in regard to their
duty to declare him free from prison and with the authorization to be
able to go to his kingdom, the archbishop reserved his consent,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>taking the time to arrange the voyage of said
Don Fernando and his son, Prince Isrrael; and having taken measures in
regard to his embarcation, and the other necessary things, fixing the
voyage for November of that same year 1762: the preliminaries of peace
were given and concluded, and the new and voluntary proposition of the
said king and his son, signed by both, in it they conceded that the
Spaniards could have a settlement and build their fort in their
principal island of Jolo. In the meanwhile, the principal fortress of
said island was to be surrendered to them as a mark of the confidence
that they had in them and of the love which they professed to so good a
king as the Catholic monarch. Also, in the island of Basilan the
Spaniards were to be allowed to place their fortress. He ceded other
distant islands which would be freely surrendered, and which were of no
use to them. No other nation was to be permitted to settle in his
kingdom without the consent of the Catholic king. All was accepted with
the reservation of the rights of his Catholic Majesty, to whom a report
was to be made.</p>
<p>22. The other ambassador from Mindanao proposed, and it also
appeared in the letters from his sultan, that he would cede Sebugay,
where he was stationed, as he was minded to move to another part of his
possessions. He would maintain the ancient peace of his ancestors with
the Spaniards, and would aid them against the other Moros, if they gave
him arms. Nothing was concluded with this envoy, because, although the
proposals were advantageous, while the archbishop was giving the matter
his attention, and although he was pushing the matter urgently, the
unexpected surprise of the English <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187"
href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>occurred. That also
occasioned this great harm that our islands would have remained in
security, and with precautions so that they might not be invaded by the
Moros, who have ruined them for so long a time; and with the
above-mentioned project for the settlement of the Spaniards in Jolo,
the settlement which the English claimed and agreed upon with Bantilan
would have been annulled. But everything was frustrated because divine
ordination must prevail over human ideas.</p>
<p>23. During that time also the disturbance which was roused up
against the Society of Jesus was quieted, some anonymous and libelous
writings being scattered and read freely, and now prohibited with two
others of new writings in these islands, which insulted it even to
excess. By means of an edict and censure that was fulminated, these
infernal stigmas were taken back, and the author of the two
above-mentioned writings having been discovered, namely, a regular, he
was corrected by means of his prelate, who without being induced and
with only the notice had begun to punish him; and it was necessary to
moderate that prelate because of the exhaustion and great age of the
culprit who now recognized his error. So much the more did the
archbishop push this matter as it was apparent to him, and he had
experienced the truly apostolic zeal of that order in these parts, and
that its workers watched with their accustomed spirit and fervor in all
that concerned the good of souls; and in the visit of the
archbishopric, they labored with the archbishop with great fruit and
his consolation. Because of their merit, and through his long and very
intimate experience of the wisdom and spirit of those religious, he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>wrote to his Holiness who has protected them so
greatly in their adverses. He stated to his Holiness what his
conscience dictated to him in favor and approval of those evangelical
workers and peculiar coadjutors of the bishops. But this letter
perished with the others in the captured ship &ldquo;La
Trinidad.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>[24]. At the same time and at the beginning of his government,
noting the orders that his Majesty had given and the extreme need of
his royal works for rebuilding or repairing them, the archbishop sent
master workmen and intelligent men to report on their condition. In
view of their inspection and in accordance with what they themselves
discovered, after a thorough inspection, those men stated the need
because of the ruin which was threatened, either in whole or in part,
of said buildings, with danger to those who lived in them and with
their dread and uneasiness. In consideration of that, after
investigations and contracts with the masters of the art, he proceeded
to the adjustment of each one, under bonds to grant them their pay in
three instalments, one-third at the beginning of the work, another
third when it was half done, and the last third at its completion. Thus
was a good beginning made in them all, and some of them were half
finished, in which condition they were overtaken by the event of the
war, for all would have been finished during the first three months of
the following year.</p>
<p>[The royal works needing repair are the hospital, the royal college
of Santa Potenciana, the college of San Phelipe, and the royal fort of
Santiago; and the sum necessary to be expended on them is slightly in
excess of forty thousand pesos. The wall of Cavite <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>is
also in a very bad condition, repeated complaints of which have been
made to the government, and to which the archbishop cannot turn a deaf
ear. The terrible hurricane of October 12, 1761, has damaged the walls
still more. Plans are drawn up by the engineers, to put which in
operation would cost one hundred and fifty thousand pesos, and would
take more than eight years. But because of the expense and time
necessary, the engineers are told to discuss a new plan, and
accordingly propose a double stockade of palma brava, which can be
constructed for ten thousand pesos and which will last at least fifteen
years. This plan is followed and is nearing completion when the English
enter. The cracks in the walls of Manila are stopped up, but the war
with the English shows its weakness, for it has been built, not so much
to withstand artillery and civilized warfare, as the attacks of Moros.
It is designed to repair the esplanades of the walls and the gun
carriages mounted thereon, but the English arrive before the stone and
timber for it can be gathered. Twenty men are kept busy, for more than
two months, polishing the one thousand two hundred muskets formerly
brought by Governor Arandia, which have become very rusty. Various
other measures are taken to bring up the military strength of the city,
which is in a wretched state so far as defense is concerned. The
treasury enters upon a new life with the assumption of government by
the archbishop, for although it has but ten thousand pesos from the new
tax, and the sums left by the bishops [<i lang="es">espolios</i>] in
1761, by September 22, 1762, when the English appear (and the annual
situado has not yet arrived), it has 138,633 pesos 5 tomins, 6 granos.
This sum includes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190"
name="pb190">190</a>]</span>36,897 pesos, 5 tomins, 6 granos, in
espolios, 40,000 pesos, which the executor of the property of Governor
Arandia is ordered to deposit there so that a pious foundation may
receive the sum left it by the abovesaid governor, and over 60,000
pesos belonging to the treasury by right. Payments are prompt, and by
the methods adopted many losses are avoided. So far as possible,
definite times are set aside for the administration of justice and
government matters. Two serious matters, especially noteworthy because
of their difficulty, are settled by the archbishop. The first is the
case of Dr. Santiago Orendain, who was proceeded against by the
predecessor of Rojo, the bishop-governor Espeleta, the case being
managed by Francisco Villacorta, one of the auditors. The archbishop
settles the matter, (which had assumed so vast proportions that
Villacorta has been excommunicated), but it breaks out again. Orendain
asks for a review of his case, which is concerned with the
administration of the funds of the <i lang="es">Cruzada</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3456src" href="#xd27e3456" name="xd27e3456src">7</a>
of which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>he has been treasurer, and the archbishop
accordingly examines the records which fill over five thousand folios.
Orendain is at last declared free after two years&rsquo; imprisonment.
The archbishop quashes the case by his decree of November 27, 1761, as
he is anxious to restore harmony, and orders the records sent to the
king. The fiscal, Francisco Viana, appeals to Auditor Simon de Anda,
who has recently come to the islands, and the matter is again stirred
up, but it is at length disposed of definitely, and the records ordered
sent to the king.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3467src" href="#xd27e3467"
name="xd27e3467src">8</a> The other case is a dispute with Simon de
Anda y Salazar in regard to the power of a single auditor to act as the
entire Audiencia in the absence of other auditors, in the issuing of
royal provisions. This special case arises over the property of the
late governor Arandia, in regard to which the judge of the property of
deceased persons has recourse to the royal Audiencia. Anda, on coming
to the islands, takes up the case, and Auditor Davila falling mortally
ill, he endeavors to take entire charge of the matter, even to the
issuing of a royal provision. This the archbishop-governor opposes on
the grounds that Anda may not issue such provisions alone. Although law
180 of the t&iacute;tulo regarding audiencias allows one auditor to act
as the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>Audiencia in case of the absence of the other
auditors, that auditor cannot determine matters finally, and despatch
royal provisions; as other laws of the same titulo forbid that. Among
such laws are 62, 63, of titulo <span class="sc">XV</span>, book ii,
and as well, 88, 106, <i>et seq.</i>, and 111.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3487src" href="#xd27e3487" name="xd27e3487src">9</a>
Notwithstanding Anda&rsquo;s wrath, the archbishop <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>maintains good relations with him, and seeks
ever to propitiate him, acting so throughout with the other auditors
and the fiscal. Since entering upon his government, it has been the
custom of the archbishop to invite all classes of people to his mass,
in order thereby to promote sociability and restrain complaints and
disturbances. The people of Manila are &ldquo;only busy for two or
three months each year, getting ready their bales for the Acapulco
ship, and during the rest [of the year] recline at ease. This ease is
the pillow and stimulus of other vices, and one of the effects which is
experienced is the multitude of clerks, and the huge amounts of copying
paper which are consumed throughout the year, especially during the
time of the above-mentioned despatch. Since from a few days after his
arrival at this city, the archbishop realized that the discord and
complaints of Christian charity arose from that vice of laziness, and
that already the dominant vice was the painful detriment of souls, he
began to use the arms of the Church against the terrible
Goliath.&rdquo; For this purpose he begins a mission, in which the love
of God and one&rsquo;s neighbor is preached. The doctrine is also
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>explained throughout the year every Sunday in
one of the three churches assigned for that purpose. After the
archbishop assumes the government of the islands his custom of
expounding the doctrine is not abated but rather increased; and he
keeps a careful watch over all ecclesiastical dispositions.]</p>
<p><i>Part Second. Of occurrences immediate to the siege in the year
62; and of the measures taken during that time; and those following the
siege until the year 63.</i></p>
<p>1. In due time, namely, at the beginning of May, a galley was
despatched to the Embocadero with the fitting aid to meet and assist
the ship &ldquo;Philipino&rdquo; which was on its return from Acapulco.
In the middle of May, another galley was despatched for the same
purpose, so that after having met the said ship and after having left
it with the other galley in San Jacinto, it might proceed to Cobadonga
and the island of Leyte. For a long time no authentic news had come
from that place except the ravages of the horrible epidemic which had
caused a great mortality, and among the deceased was the alcalde-mayor.
A person was sent in the said galley to take his place with the fitting
instructions. That person was to repair the casualties which might have
occurred, by aiding those stricken with the plague in the same manner
prescribed by the general measure for all the islands as abovesaid.</p>
<p>2. Shortly after a despatch was made to Calamianes, by a lesser
alcalde for another official, in charge of that so important post which
is located at the point of Paragua, where the construction of a fort
had been commenced during the term of the preceding governor,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>and concluded in that of the archbishop. The
latter sent some recruits and some necessary supplies by that one. Then
he also despatched an intelligent and well-instructed alcalde to the
place called Bugason,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3523src" href=
"#xd27e3523" name="xd27e3523src">10</a> which abounds in people and
rice, and which could not be well administered by the alcalde of
Yloylo, nor be conveniently stocked with food at Samboangan: for the
expenses and difficulties were doubled in conducting the fruits and
royal treasury to said capital, whence it was separated under the
suitable measures, which made manifest the need and utility of that
separation, advantageous for the royal treasury of the above-mentioned
presidio of Samboanga, and very convenient for preventing them from
giving shelter to the Moros in those districts.</p>
<p>3. The reception of the returning ship and of the one despatched
annually to Acapulco,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3528src" href=
"#xd27e3528" name="xd27e3528src">11</a> is the entire occupation of
this commerce and of the inhabitants [of this community]. It holds and
calls the attention of the governors considerably. The latter begins to
despatch measures for the careening of the ship and other things for
its preparation, at the beginning of the year. There was no other ship
than the very large one called &ldquo;La Trinidad&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3534src" href="#xd27e3534" name=
"xd27e3534src">12</a> of which advice was given to the merchants in
regard to the cargo. Its keel having been inspected, and the ship
careened <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>fully, as it was apparent to the archbishop
because of the inspection which the merchants made, that they did not
wish or could not prepare hastily more than one thousand piezas; and
having completed the distribution or allotment of the tickets in the
best manner that this labyrinth of entanglements, complaints, and
vileness permits, they began to stow the cargo in the ship, and
although it was a small cargo, they were retarded greatly by the
vendabals which began at the end of June.</p>
<p>4. At that time happened two events of little importance and
considerable bulk, which the archbishop expedited easily. One was in
regard to the master of the silver collecting the chests, according to
the new order of his Majesty, and the owners not taking them to the
palace, where they had formerly been gathered, whither he agreed; and
in regard to this matter also, the representation of the commissary of
the Inquisition, a person of learning and probity, who was well
considered because of his merit and the due respect to the holy
tribunal. But by the demand of the city and the register being already
shut away, the chests containing it had to be opened for the necessary
note of those who had not been included in said register.</p>
<p>5. The other event was that four merchants of the said city having
prepared some bales, the city delayed giving them audience in order
that they might obtain permission to register it. The hold being about
ready to be closed, they went to the archbishop. The latter granted
them license to embark some bales, on condition that the tickets of the
poor which were left could be accommodated. The others were to be for
the benefit of the royal treasury. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>outcry and clamor of
the city, which held many consultations, was great, and greater in
their letters to the viceroy and his Majesty, with ill-founded
complaints that they were deprived of liberty in regard to asking more
or less cargo space. But the archbishop, having been well informed
regarding the royal orders, and aware that the true motive for anger
was the rivalry of the merchants to their other associates, and the
application of the tickets to the royal treasury, he convinced those of
the city of these puerilities and the papers which they had written in
opposition were effectively withdrawn and they asked that the
archbishop should so do. He had only advised the viceroy on account of
the attempt of the merchants, in order that said number of piezas might
not be confiscated. In fact the merchants were convinced, and
satisfied, and thanked the archbishop.</p>
<p>6. With its small cargo of one thousand one hundred and forty-eight
piezas, this ship was able to sail from the port of Cavite, August 1.
That same day the vendavals returned with greater force than ever (and
winds which are contrary for leaving the mouth of this bay) and they
blew with tenacity and without intermission all through August. And
although the pilots did their best, and in fact once did get out
through the mouth, they anchored at the islet of Fortuna, and had to
return to the bay and take shelter behind the mountains of
Cabcave.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3547src" href="#xd27e3547" name=
"xd27e3547src">13</a></p>
<p>7. The anxiety caused by this delay obliged the archbishop to call a
meeting of the best pilots, and examine the ancient papers in regard to
the direction of the ship at departure, to see whether it was through
the Embocadero, or by way of Cabo Bojeador <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>which lies at the northern end of this island.
With the assistance of the fiscal and other intelligent persons, the
pilots believed that the course by way of Cabo Bojeador was more
expeditious and advantageous, if the ship left at the latest by the
beginning of July; but, if it were despatched, as usually happened, at
the end of July, or in August, it was to be feared that the terrible
typhoons or hurricanes of the China Sea which reach as far as the said
cape and farther, would carry it away. Consequently, it was more
advisable for the said ship to pursue its voyage through the
Embocadero, and the vendavals would be favorable to it until they left
it, and farther until they reached the Marianas. It was not late, for
other ships had left at the beginning of September. This opinion,
having been attested, was sent to the commander of the ship so that the
pilots might be informed of it. The ship left the mouth in fact on the
third of September, and reached San Jacinto in four days, where it took
wood and water aboard, and where it was overtaken by two boats or
champans with the re&euml;nforcement of food, sails, and other
supplies, which had been asked and which they would need. They sailed
from the Embocadero on the thirteenth of said month with a favoring
wind. But when they had sailed three hundred leguas, they were met by a
most violent storm. We shall discuss this misfortune in due time.</p>
<div class="figure p199width" id="p199"><img src="images/p199.jpg" alt=
"Plan of Mariveles Bay, 1764; in collection of Charts by Alexander Dalrymple ([London], 1781)"

<p class="figureHead">Plan of Mariveles Bay, 1764; in collection of
<i>Charts</i> by Alexander Dalrymple ([London], 1781)</p>
<p class="first">[<i>From copy in Library of Congress</i>]</p>
</div>
<p>8. On the fourteenth of the said month of September word was
received from the river of Canas, in a latitude a short distance from
the islet of Fortuna, that a ship and its boat had been seen in said
river. That piece of news communicated by two Indians, caused great
anxiety in Manila, and people <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201"
href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>variously conjectured as to
whether it were the &ldquo;Philipino&rdquo; or whether the
&ldquo;Trinidad&rdquo; had put back, or perhaps whether it were some
foreign ship. Order was immediately given for an official to go from
Cavite to prove the news, and follow the ship as far as possible. But
after three days of this diligence, and the ship had not been found, it
was asserted that another ship had been seen in Mariveles. Through the
neglect of the alcalde-mayor of Orani, in not having imparted this news
immediately, as he must have had bantayes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3572src" href="#xd27e3572" name="xd27e3572src">14</a> or bajias
in Mariveles, he was ordered to be imprisoned, and an official put in
his place. Without delay a message [<i lang="es">cordillera</i>] was
despatched through all the Embocadero, ordering people to be on their
guard, as a ship, whose destination and nationality were unknown, had
been seen. If the &ldquo;Philipino&rdquo; had already entered, it was
to be advised (and a letter was written to the commander with this
order) not to enter by the bay, but by Sorsogon, Camarines, or any
other place, in order to discharge its silver and despatches, and to be
on the lookout, and give full report of everything. This order was
duplicated within three days, and a galley was being prepared with an
official already appointed and the instruction advisable for this same
measure. But on going to execute it, and on embarking with the galley,
on the afternoon of September 22, it was frustrated by the sudden
entrance into the bay, at five in the afternoon of the same day, of the
English squadron.</p>
<p>9. The entrance of this squadron composed of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>thirteen ships, which formed in line and with
wind or easter astern, entered and took possession of the bay,
surprised our minds greatly. They stretched from the middle of the bay
in a circle to the point called Sangley. The confusion of Manila and
its environs with so unlooked-for a squadron, in an unprepared place
can not be imagined. The people ran through the streets. Those of the
suburbs came into the city, those of the city went outside, and there
were some persons (as was learned afterward), who started immediately
for the mountains and for Laguna. The archbishop could do no less than
be surprised, and much more the chief inhabitants and auditors who
surrounded him. But it was immediately resolved to write to the leader
of the squadron, and that was done with courtesy, asking him his
nationality and destination and granting him port and provisions
according to his need and the custom of civilized nations.</p>
<p>10. In the meanwhile, one of the most pressing anxieties and one of
danger was attended to, in regard to a large amount of powder, stored
in what is called the powder works [<i lang="es">polverista</i>], where
it is manufactured, and which is three-quarters of a legua from the
city along the beach. But in the morning of the following day, a great
portion of it remained to be brought, and the archbishop found it
necessary to go a-horseback accompanied by his Majesty&rsquo;s fiscal
and several others. At twelve o&rsquo;clock, this task was really
finished, in which there was necessarily a great waste of this
material. When they re&euml;ntered, some of the ships were almost
within cannon-shot, and were threatening in that direction, which is
toward the south, with respect to the city. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p>11. The reply of the generals was, with their letter or challenge,
arrogant, and to the effect that Manila and its forts should be
surrendered to the king of Gran Breta&ntilde;a, from whose power the
most remote possessions of the Catholic king were not free, whose
court, through its evil conduct, had proclaimed war against Ynglaterra.
If the Spaniards of Manila were not infatuated, they would surrender,
in order not to experience the severity of their powerful arms.</p>
<p>12. In view of this arrogance, the archbishop, in general council,
made the answer that was dictated by the zeal, love, and loyalty to his
king and sovereign, namely, that they would sacrifice their lives in
defense of his arms and domains, and that they would make all the
defense possible.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3597src" href="#xd27e3597"
name="xd27e3597src">15</a> They wondered at the so unlooked-for news,
and the first notice they had of the declaration of war, was that given
by the said generals with these threats and armed hand and squadron.
Having given the measures ordering the provinces to come to the aid of
the capital promptly, and those which exigency permitted, having
considered the few regular troops, and having given the musters for the
militia companies, the city suffocated with the consternation of the
conflict to which it was pledged, and which was so necessary, was
placed in a state of defense.</p>
<p>13. On the night of that day, the enemy began to disembark toward
the south. The Indians of the said places of the environs were not able
to resist the fire from their boats and ships. The people in those
places got under shelter of two regular companies <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>who
were obliged to retire. The enemy found all they could need for their
rearguard and trenches in the strong edifices of the churches of Malate
and of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia, whence without loss of time, and
with ease they surrounded and took possession of the equally strong
churches of San Tiago and San Juan de Bagumbayan, whence it became
necessary for our men to retire. And although our men made three
sallies, the enemy were only driven out for a little time from the last
place. In the last sally, especially, their attack was arranged in
three different parts in order to kill some people, but with greater
mortality on our part, and through the inequality of arms and
discipline, ours yielded ground notwithstanding that the native troops
who had come in from the neighboring provinces, were now very
numerous.</p>
<p>14. Meanwhile, a few clashes occurred, that of greatest consequence
being the death of an English officer who had left their camp with a
white flag and came toward our camp, and whom our natives attacked
without anyone being able to restrain them. They assassinated him and
hacked his body into many pieces. In the endeavor to shelter him, Don
Antonio de Sierra Tagle, the nephew of the archbishop, received many
mortal wounds from lance thrusts, from which he died in a few days. He
was a prisoner,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3606src" href="#xd27e3606"
name="xd27e3606src">16</a> and knowing him to be a relative, the
generals sent him back with the above-mentioned unfortunate officer.
The said generals learning of that assassination and mutilation,
through the infraction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href=
"#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>also of the symbol of peace (a
white flag), demanded the aggressors, with the threat that if the
demand were not accorded, they would send back the heads of the
officers whom they had captured. But the archbishop having ordered an
investigation of the matter, it resulted that the Spaniards were not to
blame, and that they had ceased firing, and all hostility, on seeing
the symbol of peace. Notwithstanding this the sepais [<i>i.e.</i>,
Sepoys] continued their fire, on account of which the Indians in
irritation, committed that assassination. With the letter and testimony
of those investigations, which the archbishop wrote to the general, the
matter seemed to be dropped.</p>
<p>15. The English made their trenches in a short time and mounted
their artillery and began to bombard the city at the bastion of the
foundry, as their fire was insufficient to reach the bastion of
Carranza,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3622src" href="#xd27e3622" name=
"xd27e3622src">17</a> and the active efforts which were able to be made
in order to undo their labors and dislodge them [<i>i.e.</i>, the
British]. Of not a little importance (amid the inequality of forces and
of practiced soldiers) was the form in a cordon of some people of this
vicinity who were considered most fitting, and of some of the natives
of the environs from the site of Pasay which is at the south near the
powder factory to that of San Lazaro, which lies to the east. The
archbishop took that precaution, as it was very necessary, in order to
guard the Pasig River at the point <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206"
href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>where the provisions are
traded, and to obtain some opposition against the enemy. The fire of
the latter, by means of their land and ship artillery, and their
bombarding, in which the bombs fired exceeded four thousand, and the
number of balls of twenty-four, a trifle more, threw the city and all
its inhabitants into great consternation. On that account, and because
the breach [in the walls] was begun to be opened, in a general council
on the night of the third of October, what ought to be done in such a
conflict was discussed.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3633src" href=
"#xd27e3633" name="xd27e3633src">18</a></p>
<p>16. Although the military men thought that they ought to capitulate,
other reputable votes were against it. One of them, namely, the
fiscal,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3641src" href="#xd27e3641" name=
"xd27e3641src">19</a> asked the engineer and military men, if what they
said was [to be understood as] in the present, and if they were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>to proceed immediately to the capitulation.
Receiving the negative answer, he, following the advice of others,
counseled defense. In view of everything and the rest which appears in
said council, the archbishop gave the orders, which appear in the
records, in regard to the work, labor, and the defensive works, with
the provision of materials, workmen, and foremen, giving charge of
these operations to the engineers, and having appointed the chiefest
military men to the most important posts, and having ordered their
vigilance in regard to the operations of the enemy. But nothing
sufficed, for, redoubling their fire, on the following day, and adding
bombs, which they discharged with their fire, which caught in two
buildings, to which it was so necessary to hasten, the day and its
night passed in moments of confusion and agony. At six in the morning
of the fifth of the above-mentioned October of 62,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e3646src" href="#xd27e3646" name="xd27e3646src">20</a> having
gained possession of its breach and of the bastion of the
foundry,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3649src" href="#xd27e3649" name=
"xd27e3649src">21</a> the English extended their troops along both
sides of the wall, and another column through the royal gate which they
forced; so that there was nothing else for the archbishop to do than to
wave the white flag and retire to the fort of San Tiago with the
ministers, and some officials and citizens. Notwithstanding that he
knew nothing of militia, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href=
"#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>had never seen such functions, and
had at his side none but equally inexperienced men, and one or two
officials who had scarcely any knowledge more than was speculative, yet
as God aided, and the loyalty of our hearts, he did what he could and
what he comprehended.</p>
<p>17. Before this misfortune befell that of the capture of the galley
which had been despatched by the commander of the
&ldquo;Philipino,&rdquo; with notice of its return from Acapulco and
that it had put back to the village of Palapa. Two days after the siege
began, namely, on the twenty-fourth of September, the galley entered
the bay and came within sight of the squadron (of which it had no
news). A fragata gave it chase and several barcas, it having been
beached already toward the north in Bancusay. Although some of those
who came in it were able to escape by swimming, its officers and the
above-mentioned Don Antonio Sierra Tagle were captured. The enemy took
possession of everything in the galley, and of many letters from which
they gathered information of the &ldquo;Philipino&rdquo; and of the
place where the latter lay. Two days later they sent a fragata and a
ship in order to capture it; for the day before they had been joined by
a ship and two fragatas which had become separated, or could not follow
the squadron.</p>
<p>18. From some quite damp letters, among them that of the commander
of the &ldquo;Philipino,&rdquo; which had been carried by those who
escaped by swimming, the archbishop learned (and it was the first news)
that the &ldquo;Philipino&rdquo; was in Palapa; that it had been unable
to enter by way of the Embocadero because of stormy weather; and that
on leaving Acapulco, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209"
name="pb209">209</a>]</span>by a letter of the viceroy to the
commander, the latter had learned of the breaking out of war with
Ynglaterra, and he was advised to have a care. Consequently, he must
have come with that information; but said commander knew nothing of
what was happening in Manila. In view of all things, and with the
unanimous opinion of auditors and principal citizens, a letter was
written to the commander, giving him an order to fortify himself in
Palapa, and to land the silver and chests. Fortifying himself as well
as possible in said port, which is very difficult to get at, and only
very experienced persons know its entrances, which with but slight work
can be made impassable, the said commander was to hold his ship in
readiness for sinking by burning, if the ships of the enemy met it.
This letter was sent with all care, by a person very skilful in the
coasts of the Embocadero, so that it reached Palapa in a very few days.
It had been duplicated as a precaution to what might happen to it at
its first sending.</p>
<p>19. The rest that was done for the defense of the place was placed
in the diary. Some measures not necessary there were stated here as
belonging to the operations of the archbishop, such as those in regard
to withdrawing the treasury and the commission of Auditor Don Simon de
Anda. Both measures were vigorously promoted by the auditors&mdash;the
first, at the request of the treasurer, Don Nicolas de Echauz<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3666src" href="#xd27e3666" name=
"xd27e3666src">22</a> on the first day of the siege. Although it was at
the instance of the auditors, the archbishop resisted it strongly, for
the reason that the treasury could not be in better security than where
there was security <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210"
name="pb210">210</a>]</span>of their lives. But reiterating their
instances for various reasons, and that it was advisable under any
circumstances to have placed the money outside the city, the archbishop
had to comply; and ordered that some quantity having been left, the
greater part should be withdrawn. Accordingly, this was done, and the
sum of one hundred and eleven thousand pesos withdrawn. Of the amount
left in the treasury, ten thousand pesos were paid out in order to
supply the city with provisions. In regard to that various precautions
were taken, and a commission was given to the fiscal, in order that he
might attend to those supplies. Other sums also followed for the
current expenses, all of which made the sum of twenty-four thousand
pesos, account of which is to be given by the accountant, Don Fernando
Carabes of whom it was demanded urgently by the archbishop.</p>
<p>20. The other measure in regard to Auditor Anda was passed with
greater haste by the auditors themselves on the third of October.
Because of the conflict in which we found ourselves, they told the
archbishop that it was advisable to despatch him outside the city with
the title of governor and captain-general. These titles were to be
given him, in order that he might keep the natives quiet in their
Christian instruction and in their obedience to the king. But
notwithstanding that this measure clothed itself in so specious
reasons, the archbishop answered that neither he nor the Audiencia had
any authority to create a governor and captain-general, which was the
proper privilege of his Majesty; and that it was enough to give him the
title of visitor of the land for the so just end that was claimed
(which is in accordance with the orders of his Majesty), and the title
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>lieutenant of the captain-general which could be
conferred on him. This was the custom followed in like commissions to
ministers. Since that seemed advisable to the ministers and fiscal, it
was executed with the celerity that the present conflicts demanded.
Furnishing him with official paper, and a notary and advocate, the
above-mentioned auditor Anda left immediately that night.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3678src" href="#xd27e3678" name=
"xd27e3678src">23</a></p>
<p>21. Other operations during the time of the siege which looked to
the care and watch of the city, the archbishop practiced vigilantly.
For he visited the walls personally, even at night, and some of the
bastions, namely that of the foundry and that of the fort. He went out
daily on horseback. Accompanied by various persons he examined the
gates and outside walls, the small fort, and the house of San Fernando,
where, as well as through all Bancuray and Tondo, the natives who
descended from the provinces lodged. Regulations were made there for
them, and they were aided with provisions. The arms that it was
possible to give were furnished them, and they were drilled in some
manner. In short the archbishop omitted nothing in order that he might
go to give the orders which appeared advisable, and personally, at the
sites where his presence seemed necessary or advisable.</p>
<p>22. The archbishop having retired, then, as above-mentioned, into
the royal fort of San Tiago, the articles of capitulation were begun to
be drawn up there. They were concluded after great labor, and received
the unanimous consent of the auditors and other military men and
citizens who were present. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>The enemy already having taken
possession of the city, extended their troops in two columns toward the
said fort, along the walls, and other companies in front protected by
the royal chapel. As a white flag was immediately flung in the fort,
there was no hostility directed toward the small citadel. Two officers
entered with a message from their general, demanding surrender. But
within a short time the colonel of those troops appeared, and demanded
an instant surrender, or one would be forced by arms. The archbishop
gave him the articles of capitulation with a message to his general. He
refused to receive them, and there were no means or manner to get him
to receive them and take them to his general. Consequently, they had to
abide by what the colonel tenaciously answered, namely, that the
general&rsquo;s order was the one which he had already expressed, and
that it was now no time to tire themselves out in demands and replies
concerning the surrender.</p>
<p>23. At this pass, and in view of what was already passing in the
presence of the archbishop in said fort, as the soldiers were throwing
themselves from its esplanade and from the walls, and casting
themselves into the river, and as some officers and regular troops
there, who never surpassed eighty in number were also in part doing the
same as the other soldiers, with not a few of the citizens; and as the
said fort was in itself indefensible, and the principal curtain which
looked on the city, and in front of which was the enemy, was
threatening to fall into ruins; the archbishop found no other expedient
in this conflict than to offer the colonel to accompany him to treat
with his general in regard to the fort and surrender under his word of
honor of the exemption from harm <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213"
href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>and safety of his person. He
condescended to that without any of the bystanders, or auditors who
surrounded him offering to take that matter upon themselves, or even to
accompany him, except the master-of-camp and another officer. With them
and the said colonel, he went to the royal palace where the general had
already taken up his quarters.</p>
<p>24. After the salutation and the respective courtesies, in which
General Draper was profuse (and he showed special veneration to the
archbishop), the latter handed him the articles of capitulation that
had been drawn up, and which treated of the surrender of the fort. The
general answered that Admiral Cornish, whom he was awaiting from his
ship, must also be consulted. But after a long time with incessant
interruptions because of the continual coming of the general&rsquo;s
officers to get his orders, and of many of ours who presented
themselves to him, the general said that since Cornish was giving time,
the archbishop should give the order for the surrender, and that that
would be best, because he knew the harshness of the nature of said
admiral. Answer was made that the order would be given under all the
military honors which were fitting. All these conferences passed by
means of two interpreters&mdash;one in the English language, and the
other in the French with a mixture of Latin in which the archbishop
talked and which the general understood, although they both pronounced
it in accordance with their native languages. Consequently, it was
difficult for them to understand one another. Nevertheless, the
archbishop comprehended, and not confusedly, that the general agreed to
the condition proposed, and the archbishop gave the order for the
surrender of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214"
name="pb214">214</a>]</span>fort. The latter did not properly merit
this name because of its weakness, and the dislodging already
mentioned, by which it could have no defense, but manifest danger of
life to those who remained there, and even of those who remained in the
city.</p>
<p>25. Great was the confusion of that day, and the grief of the fierce
sack. After the sack had lasted six hours, the archbishop requested the
general to forbid it, saying that neither church nor palace would be
left. The general went in person to attend to this, and by the
diligence of his men killed one, and maltreated another, who was
wounded in an arm, and commanded three to be hanged among whom was an
Indian of tender years, and it appears with small grounds as only a few
balls were found on him. But as a matter of fact, the sack continued
for more than thirty hours, as was asserted to the archbishop, on
account of which the latter made frequent requests of the general. But
in this madness of the sack, the very house servants had not a little
part and guilt, taking advantage of this unfortunate occasion. And as
regards the suburbs of the city, malicious persons and robbers by
profession (who abound in these districts) as well as the very natives
who had come from the provinces, and much more, the characteristic
perversity of the Sangleys executed this destruction on the churches
and many houses.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3697src" href="#xd27e3697"
name="xd27e3697src">24</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href=
"#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>26. The afternoon of the same day, both chiefs, Draper and Cornish,
sent the archbishop the conditions under which the city would be free
from the sack, the life of the citizens, and their possessions,
commerce, and religion, saved, namely, by the surrender of Cavite, and
the payment of four million pesos, two million to be paid at once. In
this manner, they would consider the articles of the capitulation that
had been signed by the archbishop, auditors, and city. Those articles
were sent shortly after on the same day by the generals, approved with
some restrictions as may be seen by all in their originals and in the
testimonies placed in the collection of papers.</p>
<p>27. From that afternoon a general council was called of all estates,
who met on the following morning to deliberate in regard to said
conditions. The archbishop ordered all to discuss the matter of the
said millions, while he was treating with the military men and auditor
of war in regard to Cavite. The latter excused themselves from
expressing an opinion under pretext of being prisoners of war,
whereupon the archbishop wrote to the general, asking him to declare
that those who were in the fort were not prisoners, and that meanwhile
he could not answer regarding Cavite. But he had not despatched said
letter, before he received a message from the generals in regard to the
fulfilment of their conditions, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216"
href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>with the instant and terrible
threat, that if the contrary was done, they would put them all to the
sword without excepting a single person. Within a few moments the same
message was repeated by means of a Siquite [Sepoy?]. Both messages were
heard by all the Spaniards of the council, and by many others who were
in the palace; and it was learned for certain that the order was given
to the colonel, who had drawn up his troops in front of the palace, and
had taken the entrances of the streets. Answer was made that a reply
would be given in a very short time. The archbishop, thereupon, turning
to all the above-mentioned persons in the council, told them that they
should determine without delay what was most advisable in regard to the
millions, and that they should do it while he was deliberating with the
military men regarding Cavite. The latter, with the auditor of war
(forgetful of their opposition toward giving an opinion a short time
before), not only gave one, by which Cavite was to be immediately
surrendered, but even asked that with great insistence. Being
reprimanded and asked why now they gave their opinion which they had
refused so tenaciously a short time before, they answered that
circumstances had changed in a few moments by the ruin that threatened
all in a short time.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3712src" href=
"#xd27e3712" name="xd27e3712src">25</a> The council also resolved that
the four millions should be given, the silver of the pious funds,
chaplaincies etc., found existing being given immediately, while the
rest demanded would be given from the wealth in the
[&ldquo;Philipino?&rdquo; <i>MS. worn</i>]. What remained would be paid
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>by his Majesty, since there was no other
recourse except his royal clemency. The paper containing this
proposition was signed by the archbishop, and by the auditors and chief
citizens.</p>
<p>28. In such a predicament, in which the archbishop conceived all
without any exception to be defendants and thrown into consternation,
he found no other means than to agree to the above-mentioned
proposition, which put in writing and signed by the chief persons, was
taken by two commissaries to the generals, and also the order for the
surrender of Cavite, stating that no move toward resistance would be
made, and taking the precaution of sending a suitable officer for that
purpose. The generals answered the commissaries that, if what they said
was contained in the paper, they would allow them to ascertain that
through their interpreter; and that since two of their ships had gone
in search of the &ldquo;Philipino,&rdquo; if they had already captured
it, they [<i>i.e.</i>, the Spaniards] ought not to reckon on it in the
payment, of which they could make use if it were not already captured.
In accordance with this, a letter was to be written to the commander of
the &ldquo;Philipino;&rdquo; and the abovesaid notice was to be
executed ordering him to come from Palapa to this [city? <i>MS.
worn</i>]. This letter agreed to by all the council and signed by the
archbishop was shown to the generals and was despatched to [that
commander?] by two of the chief inhabitants, who sent it safely; though
as yet we are ignorant of its receipt, and it has been rumored that it
has been intercepted on the way, and that even a contrary order has
been given without us knowing by whom.</p>
<p>29. The sum found in the pious funds, chaplaincies, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>etc., was really ascertained and delivered.
There was some difference in it because of the small coins which had
been clipped, and which were received by weight. To this sum was added
the amount of the wrought silver of the churches (in which it appears
that in some churches some of the silver was reserved). There was a
measure enacted by the archbishop, in virtue of what was discussed in
the general council and of present circumstances. The superiors and the
administrators of said church, who were notified thereof, agreed, and
they made the delivery without any answer or protest; for they saw well
that, although the secular estate contributed with &iexcl;ts interests
in the &ldquo;Philipino,&rdquo; it would be impossible to get during
those days a suitable distribution among the citizens (and as it
seemed), the destruction of the sack had left them without money or
anything of value, as they declared. Besides all their powers could
never make enough and be sufficient for the whole or half of the
contribution demanded. And the silver of the churches being in sight,
it was the best stimulus and incentive of greed, robbery, and of
violence, and with profanation of the altars and of the sacristy, as
had already been begun to be experienced, not only from the English
troops, but also from the natives themselves and the domestics, and the
especially covetous Sangleys. Not only did these misfortunes disturb
the heart of the archbishop, but also the gloomy consideration of the
Moros, those ancient enemies, who annually raided the provinces, and of
whom it was conjectured that, hearing of our fatality, they would feed
themselves with more audacity on their robberies, sacrileges, and
piracies, as, in fact, has been experienced even in a village near
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>the mouth of Marivelez which is the mouth of
this bay. Thence, after their accustomed molestations, they have taken
one hundred captives of both sexes, and, from the island of Marinduque,
they have taken one hundred persons and the Jesuit missionary of that
island.</p>
<p>30. It befell that in order to obviate so many inconveniences, they
did not hesitate in taking from the altars the silver for the
redemption and relief, which was the least danger to the faithful
Catholics. By this arrangement, the payment of his Majesty was reduced,
from whose royal magnificence has originated the rich adornment of the
churches. But the sacred vases which belong immediately to divine
worship were always reserved, as were also the chalices, cups, and
monstrances. In these circumstances, the archbishop voluntarily
delivered all his valuables and vases without reserving his pectoral or
anything else, in order to aid so far as he was concerned in the ransom
of the city, and in order that he might serve as an example, so that
his [<i>MS. worn</i>] might not excuse himself from contributing
voluntarily whatever was possible. And as it was not proper that, in
these public calamities, and of the despoliation of his own spouse, the
cathedral church, he should remain with adornment and should not be
deprived of everything; and although his said possessions were not of
any considerable importance, he had the consolation of not reserving
anything and of giving them up with good will. Of money in cash he gave
none, for he had none, nor, since he has been in these islands, has he
had any left from his pay and stipends, for he has spent them all in
the support of his household, on the poor, and for the relief of many
necessities, always <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220"
name="pb220">220</a>]</span>grieving at not helping them all, because
excessive sums would have been required (as those necessities were many
and grave). For this same reason, by order of the [English] commissary
of artillery, the bells were taken down (as spoils that belonged to
them) from the churches of the city and its environs. The archbishop,
grieving over the loss of his charge, set his mind on ransoming the
bells of the cathedral and royal chapel, but since he had not come to
these islands with wealth to execute it, he gave an order against his
agent in Cadiz, ordering him to pay the sum of five thousand pesos for
which they were redeemed, notwithstanding that a very small sum
remained in the possession of the said agent to comply with the order.
But the great confidence which assists him in the above-mentioned
animated the archbishop.</p>
<p>31. Advised of the scattering of the Spaniards since the day of the
assault, and that they were going to the villages and mountain, where
they were in danger from the barbarians and the revolted natives (as
was experienced in many disasters, thefts, and murders), and their
families in other directions not any more secure, and others in the
city and its precincts, an order was issued for all to assemble and
come to live in the city with those who were there. That order had
little effect, for each one followed his own opinion and will, and
began to lose his obedience to his superior. This was aided not a
little by the example of those who by their employ and dignity ought to
have given a better example.</p>
<p>32. Better fruit was obtained in ecclesiastical matters (although
that not sufficient and advisable), for the prebendaries and some of
the secular clergy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221"
name="pb221">221</a>]</span>continued to assemble at the cathedral, and
in the convents of the regulars some religious remained. They were
requested and charged not to abandon their churches, and to endeavor to
have a suitable number of subjects for the continuance of divine
worship, and to be the relief and consolation of the faithful, and that
they might be able to attend to their necessities in the administration
of the sacraments.</p>
<p>33. Thus was it done for the most part, but it was not that which
was advisable and sufficient to meet other casualties, which the
superiors of the Society satisfied. He was the only provincial prelate
who remained living [in the city], together with that of St. John of
God, whose superiors and subjects complied perfectly with their
respective ministries. On account of this defect, or non-existence of
the superior, it appears that the persecution by the English of the
Augustinian fathers or their opposition to them had no reparation; and
although their provincial was indeed near Manila, his passage to the
city was prevented.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3750src" href=
"#xd27e3750" name="xd27e3750src">26</a> The other superiors, although
not provincials, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222"
name="pb222">222</a>]</span>met respectively what arose in their
orders, but their powers did not reach to the subjects outside [the
city] nor did they gain the respect of the English within. And the
English qualifying as having committed excesses those Augustinian
religious and others, who appeared before them, who were commanding the
natives outside, proceeded to imprisonments, exiles, and confiscations
of property, especially in the above-mentioned, taking possession of
their church, money, valuables, and everything else that they
had.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3757src" href="#xd27e3757" name=
"xd27e3757src">27</a> It is enough to have touched this point, for it
would be most tedious to set forth all its particulars in detail; and
it does not belong to the archbishop to qualify the facts, since each
superior must give account of them to the king, our sovereign, with the
religious sincerity which he professes, and to show their complaints
with the same truth. But he cannot restrain his wonder as to how the
father visitor and the father of this province of San Juan de Dios, the
reverend Father Puga,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3763src" href=
"#xd27e3763" name="xd27e3763src">28</a> a priest, with his community
attended and attends to his institute, sheltering and assisting so
great a number of sick and poor amid so great calamity and so many
necessities, and who not having the slight regular alms, does not fail
at all to his sick, the religious aiding them. This is properly a
miracle of charity. The persecution which this superior and community
has suffered, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>from the one who has taken command of the
government is as painful as their patience is praiseworthy and
exemplary.</p>
<p>34. The destruction which was experienced in the suburbs of Manila
and in other more distant places, from robbery, murders, and other
execrable atrocities, obliged the archbishop to endeavor to restrain
the evildoers and insurgents by means of Don Josef Busto, a person of
spirit and of great experience in the land, with a company of men to
his satisfaction. He was ready to do it, but asked a suitable salary
after he had formed his account.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3776src"
href="#xd27e3776" name="xd27e3776src">29</a> Thereupon, the archbishop
ordered that one of the citizens, who had not suffered from the sack
and was wealthy, to make ready two thousand pesos which would be placed
to his account and apportioned to the sum which was to be demanded from
him for the contribution of the millions; and that the senior auditor,
who exercised the office of auditor of war, would give the instructions
and powers necessary to said Busto for the above-mentioned end. But
both persons excused themselves most strongly, the above-mentioned
citizen with the frivolous remark that he had nothing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>which he could supply, the auditor by saying
that he was a prisoner of war, and a mere assessor in these matters.
The first was a bit of frivolity, and the second a pretext, for when
the governor is an ecclesiastic, the auditor expedites and determines
by himself criminal causes which arise; and thus did it happen with the
archbishop during the time of the siege and before in like causes with
the same auditor. But since the reins of obedience and respect had
already been broken, and there were no forces to reduce them to their
duty, like other matters, this remained thus without the due remedy,
and the disasters continued through insolence and libertinage.</p>
<p>35. During this time also, Auditor Anda had declared himself
governor, captain-general, and royal Audiencia, and had despatched
messages [<i lang="es">cordilleras</i>] ordering himself to be so
recognized in the provinces. And he had ordered and commenced to cut
off the provisions in the two districts of Bulacan and Laguna whence
they come to the city. In these raids, happened the murders of natives
and English in the suburbs, and the latter were mutilated and treated
with other contempts suitable for barbarians. Other events had preceded
with the religious of Bulacan where Anda was, and the English chiefs of
whom it was spoken variously. The archbishop cannot speak with
exactness, as he does not know of those events, only that on one
occasion, posterior to that time, in which the Augustinian<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3791src" href="#xd27e3791" name=
"xd27e3791src">30</a> fathers were discussed before many, the
archbishop alleged publicly in their favor (led rather by his
inclination to piety than by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href=
"#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>the judgment which he had formed
then of their guilt or innocence), as well as in favor of all the
religious who were present in their convents; for he held several
divine offices, and protected them so far as he could, although he was
unable to prevent the English from embarking and sending nine of them
in the English fragatas which went to Madrasta.</p>
<p>36. It appears that, on account of the said causes, and (as is
known) from other apprehensions or imaginations, the British leaders
proscribed the above-named auditor, and it was added that they had
offered a reward for his person. The auditors learning this, went to
the archbishop with this notice, and great fright; and for the time
being there were no means by which to assure their lives. But within a
short time a hasty message from the general to the archbishop, ordering
him to cause that auditor to appear, together with the alcalde-mayor of
Bulacan and other nearby alcaldes in order that, on the twenty-fifth
day of October, they might, together with the city and the military
men, take the oath of allegiance to his Britannic Majesty, and give
their word of honor not to take arms against his nation during the war,
and until the kings should agree or decide the fate of these islands.
The archbishop replied to this message that he was unable to cause the
appearance of Auditor Anda, since they had proscribed him, which was
equivalent to handing him over to death; and that so long as Anda was
not secure of his life he could not make him appear. In regard to the
alcalde of Bulacan and the others, he could as little cause them to
come, because in the lack of any one to govern and restrain the
natives, their disturbance and revolt would increase all the more.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span></p>
<p>37. In order that he might inform the auditors of this event, the
archbishop had them summoned, and with them, namely, the fiscal and the
senior auditor, he began to discuss what they ought to do in regard to
Auditor Anda. While they were conferring thus, Auditor Galban came with
the marquis of Monte Castro, who were with General Draper at the time
when my above-mentioned reply or message was given to him. He sent them
so that they might discuss and talk over this point with the
archbishop. They told him that he could rest assured of the life of
Anda, and the general answered the same through his envoy. The
conference lasted for more than three hours, with various commotions,
without the auditors caring to express their opinion, giving as an
excuse that the said general had told those above-mentioned that they
were all prisoners of war, with the exception of the archbishop. On the
night of said day, said ministers presented to the archbishop a
writing, leaving in his hands and judgment as the one to whom the
matter pertained, the appearance of said Anda.</p>
<p>38. But in order to meet this matter better, he had some of the
foremost military officers invited, to whom he told all that had
passed. They were of the opinion that he should cause the said Anda to
retire, under security of his life, for he was incurring a great
danger, and exposing the lives of many with his disturbances; and to
shut off the provisions carries the same risk. [They were all of this
opinion] except one military man, who asserted that if Bulacan was a
separate province and had a fort or bastion, Anda ought not to be
summoned, for then he could defend himself. But said province is very
near Manila, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>being separated therefrom by only a distance of
three or four hours, and it never had a bastion or fortress except that
which very lately was constructed by order of the said Anda, and which
the English demolished as will be told later.</p>
<p>39. In accordance with this opinion, the archbishop asked the
general for assurance of the life of the abovesaid, in writing, and it
was sent to him in the English language. The archbishop had it
translated into our language, and kept in his possession the original
paper. The above-mentioned copy was enclosed to him, and at the bottom
of it the archbishop assured him that it was a faithful copy, and that
he had had it copied into our language in order that Anda might
understand it. He gave Anda strict orders to appear, but the latter
replied discourteously with several absurdities, which the archbishop
answered by noting his rudeness, and stating that he should have been
addressed with the title of governor, and of Anda&rsquo;s disrespect in
judging him [<i>i.e.</i>, the archbishop] to be the secretary of the
British. The archbishop also showed Anda other errors which he
suffered, and sent him the original paper of safety, so that he might
make use of it in the way that he pleased, and said that he would make
a charge before God and the king of his excesses.</p>
<p>40. From that time until the present Anda continued his orders to
prevent any food from being taken down to the city. But he has never
been able to succeed in more than that the price of food has risen. He
has not considered that the greater part of the garrison were prisoners
in the city with the archbishop, with their officers, two togated
ministers, and the officials of the royal treasury (except the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>treasurer), and the majority of the persons
composing both cabildos, ecclesiastical and secular, various religious
of all the communities, a convent of nuns, the beater&iacute;os and
schools of both sexes, and most of the citizens of all classes and
estates. He has not reflected that his obstinacy in this measure in any
event and in any manner in which it might have any desired effect,
resulted, before any injury to the English, in that of all these
vassals of the king, afflicted and opposed by both parts. He has taken
no account of the lack of success that could be hoped for from such a
project, as has been shown, as he has not sufficient arms or
disciplined men with which to oppose a nation which, besides having the
city garrisoned and that of Cavite, and in both a good provision in the
storehouses, dominated also the sea with their boats, with which in
case of necessity, they could furnish provisions in plenty.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3818src" href="#xd27e3818" name=
"xd27e3818src">31</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href=
"#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>41. This temerity has been the origin of many evils, which have
increased the misfortune of these inhabitants, both secular and
religious. They have been reduced to prison on various occasions, with
sufficient contempt, occasioning that, together with injury to the
natives, notable disturbances, disasters, fires, murders, robberies,
and rapines have been experienced through the same agents and other
evildoers. They have even been propagated through diverse places and
estates with the destruction of their fields and herds; and, on the
other side, the English irritated, not only have committed in the
vicinity of Manila, many annoyances, burning of villages and buildings,
and taking by force of arms (without resistance), all kinds of grain
and animals, food, and a very great number of buffaloes, which were
destined for the plough and the cultivation of the land, but they have
also penetrated into some provinces with very few men, taking therefrom
whatever they have wished, as they did in the month of November in the
village of Pasig, where especially the food of all the Lake of Bay was
gathered, and where trenches had been made in the church and convent.
With all kinds of arms they had been occupied by ten thousand Indians,
who were defeated at their first arrival by five hundred English. About
one thousand five hundred of both sexes and all ages were killed, part
of them with gun and cannon, and part precipitated into and drowned in
the river Pasig. From that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href=
"#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>time a detachment of English
troops remained in said village.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3831src"
href="#xd27e3831" name="xd27e3831src">32</a> For that reason the
English have penetrated about all the lake and through the province of
Taal and Balayan, and have always brought vast supplies of food for
their troops and for the storehouses. All these inhabitants always
furnish them (for their money) with flesh, wheat, and palay. In any
other way they would have suffered many more miseries. In the month of
February, they did the same in Bulacan, which was the province where
the above-mentioned Anda had established his fort in the church and
convent. They advanced and forced his trenches, where some Spaniards
and religious were killed, and four hundred Indians were put to the
sword. The only difference was that in this place they did not carry
back provisions or fortify themselves, but retired after demolishing
the fortifications in the convent. They have also made many extortions
in other villages which they would not have done had they not been
provoked.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3837src" href="#xd27e3837" name=
"xd27e3837src">33</a></p>
<p>42. All these injuries and many others, which are the necessary
sequel of them, the archbishop thought over from that beginning, [which
had been] without any fruit or advantage to our side, but, indeed, had,
on the contrary, the pernicious effects that experience has proved, and
which had already commenced to show themselves. Consequently, he found
it necessary to write to Anda again, mitigating with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>greatest mildness the ardor of his preceding
letter, in order that Anda might consider these calamities, and change
direction, increasing and arranging the terms of his commission as
visitor of the land and lieutenant of the captain-general. But there
was no other answer to this letter except notice of its receipt written
on its envelope.</p>
<p>43. A like effect was obtained by the order that he gave in his
letter to the treasurer, ordering him to transfer to the city the money
in his care, in order that it might escape the theft which many evil
natives had attempted. They would have succeeded in one of their most
vigorous attacks, had not this disturbance been calmed by the alcalde
of Pagsanjan, the marquises of Villamediana and Monte Castro being
present. The latter were abused by three Franciscan religious, who,
armed, captained the Indians in order to get possession of the
treasury. In order to avoid this danger and the loss of this money, the
archbishop had conferred with the generals, saying that he would hand
it over to them on condition that it be reckoned as a part of the
millions demanded, and that they supply him with the pay for the
ministers, officers, troops, and others whose support depended on his
Majesty. The relief of the community would also follow the exhibition
of this treasury, and would lessen the payment of his Majesty. Nothing
sufficed to make the treasurer Echauz obey. He went to Pampanga with
the treasury, which he placed at the disposition of Auditor Anda, who
began to use it recently for the expenses which he believed advisable
or necessary, according to his projects.</p>
<p>44. To the question of the British, which was urgently put to him,
in regard to the royal treasury <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232"
href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>and possessions, the
archbishop responded briefly and truly, showing them that the king, his
master, had no temporal interest in these islands, but only that
strictly of the souls of his vassals, and the causing them to live as
civilized beings and Christians, according to the Catholic law for
their salvation; and that in order to maintain them with his
ecclesiastical and secular ministers, he spent the tributes which were
collected with so great right, and the two departments only of buyo and
wine. In this regard he distributed very large sums annually from the
treasury of Mexico. In no other manner could these islands subsist.</p>
<p>45. The city, orders, and Spaniards having been summoned to the
royal palace, in order to express their loyalty and not to take arms
against his Britannic Majesty, before his generals, an act in which
their loyalty and love to his Catholic Majesty, their legitimate king,
shone forth brightly, through the unwillingness, sadness, and
repugnance, with which it was celebrated. Slightly before as well and
separately was given the word of honor not to take arms during the war
or until another arrangement was made by the sovereigns (in a certain
Latin form, and which necessarily contained nothing of vassalage to his
Britannic Majesty), by the archbishop, auditors, and royal officials
present. The polite representation of the archbishop to the generals in
the said house where they were lodging, namely, the archiepiscopal,
enabled them [<i>i.e.</i>, the above officials] to gain exemption from
mixing with the others, or in their formula [of loyalty or allegiance
to the British sovereign].</p>
<p>46. Thence, at their instance, they [<i>i.e.</i>, the cabildo,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>religious, and Spaniards] were conducted to the
royal palace, and in the presence of so numerous a gathering, a paper
was read, in which the archbishop was reproved as one who robbed from
the churches, the sum to which their silver amounted, and that of the
pious funds already delivered and received; and that in regard to this,
that silver would soon complete a million. And now he was about to
surrender the forces and islands dependent on Manila. By that paper the
heart of the archbishop was wounded as if by a double-edged sword. On
two points he was unable to restrain his wrath, and he uttered in the
presence of the two generals the words that his zeal dictated to him,
namely, that the instance and threat of the victors had been necessary
for the withdrawal of the abovesaid silver, and there were no other
resources near at hand. He does not rob, who makes use, in extreme
need, of the most sacred thing, which is destined in such cases most
suitably to the living temples of God, namely, His faithful. But he
cannot clear himself from this sacrilegious crime, who causes it by
violence, and who willingly and eagerly receives its effects, and
whatever is left over and above them. In regard to the second point,
that meant to attempt another act of violence quite contrary to the day
and to the act which was being celebrated on it to the honor and memory
of the birthday of his Britannic Majesty, whose protection he implored,
so that such a matter might not be discussed on such a day. And the
archbishop insisted that he would sacrifice his life for his
faithfulness to his king, and for his honor, which would be vindicated
by his Catholic Majesty, his sovereign. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p>47. With this expression of anger, the archbishop retired to his
room, where the above-mentioned paper was sent him. In order to
deliberate on its contents, he had a general council summoned for next
day, October 26, consisting of the ministers, the chief military men,
and the city and ecclesiastical [cabildos]. In a few words the
archbishop explained to the council the arguments pro and con regarding
the cession of the islands. Since he gave all his attention and time to
this, he ordered a council of those interested to discuss, with the
assistance of the fiscal, and under the presidency of the senior
auditor, the matter of the completion of the million. The result of
that discussion will be stated later.</p>
<p>48. But in regard to the point of the islands, which was discussed
in general council, the regulars excused themselves from voting, by
saying that their rules forbade them to vote on war questions, and that
they feared to act irregularly. The archbishop was unable to overlook
this pretext, and told them that they had voted in like assemblies at
the time of the siege, and had permitted or given license to their
subjects to take all kinds of arms, to patrol the walls, and to guard
the posts which were entrusted to them; and had sent the Indians from
their villages to take part in the conflict. They had not done
otherwise in their missions exposed to the dangers of the Moros, than
to manufacture and buy all sorts of arms, and importune the superior
government to supply arms to them, and afterward to handle them and
make use of them in defense of their parishioners, and to fight the
enemies of the faith and religion. At present it was not necessary to
take these arms or to make use of them, but it was necessary to declare
what was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>advisable in regard to conceding or denying the
submission of the provinces in which religion and the instruction of
their neophytes were at stake. But nothing was sufficient to get them
to give their vote, that which the archbishop had alleged causing them
great irritation. As their obstinacy angered the archbishop still more,
he did not have them summoned to the second council.</p>
<p>49. In the voting of that council of the twenty-sixth, it happened
that the engineer, by whom the voting commenced, refused strongly to
pass any opinion, saying that he was prevented from doing so, as he was
a prisoner of war. This murmur spread among the other military men
present, and they added that the license of the generals was necessary
in order that this council might be held. Consequently, it was
necessary for the archbishop to explain these matters, by telling them
that this was not a clandestine council, but one called openly and in
plain sight and with the knowledge and suffrance of the generals. In it
they were not discussing the taking of arms by the prisoners for the
defense of the provinces, but whether the islands were to be yielded
under present circumstances by the archbishop-governor. Thereupon, the
voting went on with varying results. When it came to the fiscal&rsquo;s
vote, he again was obstinate on the points prisoners of war and the
license of the generals for the council, and he said that he would
accordingly take his position on the principle of it. The archbishop
answered what he had said in regard to the said points, and that this
was to place in doubt what he had signed. Thereupon, there was great
altercation, anger, and notable incivility, with visible signs of the
agony <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>which the archbishop was suffering from this
blow. But the altercation having subsided, and all of them having
quieted down, the fiscal and other ministers declared their vote. Since
it was now very late and the vote was not cleared up, and since it
could not be well enough discerned at that time, it was ordered that
the same council be convoked on the following day, with the exception
of the regulars.</p>
<p>50. In fact, on the following day, October 27, another council was
held in the afternoon. At it the archbishop had the Latin letter read
which he had received on the morning of that day from General Draper,
with the date of the twenty-eighth (which corresponds to the
twenty-seventh of our reckoning and calendar). The vote was put, and
some who had given their vote in the negative on the preceding day,
namely, not to surrender the islands, retracted, and voted
affirmatively. The ministers and some others expressed their opinion
and gave it in writing. The vote was equally cast with but a little
difference of one or two votes. The archbishop asserted that he would
decide without delay what appeared most advisable to him, commending,
as he had done, so grave a matter to our Lord, so that He might inspire
him as to what was for His best service and that of His as well as our
Catholic king. Before dissolving this council, an envoy came from
General Draper with another letter bearing date of the twenty-eighth
(which corresponds in our calendar to the twenty-seventh) written in
the English language. It was read there by an interpreter. It was
reduced to saying that, with only the cession of a few places of little
importance, he would save (he gave to understand with whom he spoke,
namely the archbishop) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>the lives of a multitude; that he
was sure that his Catholic Majesty would consider himself as well
served; and that those who were endeavoring to persuade the archbishop
not to yield, if they did not promptly change their opinion, would
answer with their lives, and that the auditors were to affix their
signatures.</p>
<p>51. All those present having heard the context of the
above-mentioned letter, without any more being added or mentioned than
what was declared in the above-mentioned council, it was dissolved, and
the thorn (which was very sharp) remained in the heart of the
archbishop in deliberating on so serious a point. In that deliberation
the least thing involved was the danger to his own life, of which he
was tired and of which he almost desired the end. But that is always
placed in the hands of divine Providence who directs everything
positively or permissively for His greater service and glory. Not only
did he consider the extermination of the city and the lives of many
with which he was threatened, but also (and which was very easy), the
uneasiness of the villages and missions of the provinces, in great part
ruined and destroyed by their old-time enemies, the Moros, who with a
little stimulus and encouragement from their new enemies would assault
them on all sides and would finish with their mission ministers and
justices. It was greatly to be feared that if the natives were offered
exemption from tribute, and subjection, they would be the instruments
of these disasters.</p>
<p>52. This effort tied the hands of the English, who irritated by a
negative answer, could have assigned two fragatas of their squadron to
coast along the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238"
name="pb238">238</a>]</span>provinces, and cause this horrible
uneasiness. If they did that, (unless it was averted by divine
Providence), the ruin of the instruction and faith of the neophytes
would be experienced. These reasons having been meditated upon before
Jesus Christ, our life, from whose service depended that of a Catholic
king, the archbishop resolved on the twenty-eighth to avoid the greater
evil, and to assure the conservation of the islands, and the teaching
and doctrine of our holy religion in them by keeping their natives
quiet. Thereupon, on the said day, and on the following, the
twenty-ninth, he wrote letters to the prelates and to the provinces,
with the intention of using them opportunely;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3884src" href="#xd27e3884" name="xd27e3884src">34</a> and without
making mention of those letters, he replied on the date of the
twenty-ninth<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3887src" href="#xd27e3887"
name="xd27e3887src">35</a> in the Latin language to the above-mentioned
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>letter, also in Latin, of General Draper,
explaining to him diffusely and vigorously the difficulty of What he
asked. His reasons, if they did not suffice to convince him, lessened
the violence and force which were uttered a thousand times in said
letter.</p>
<p>53. He summoned the auditors in order to show this letter to them,
but they did not come as they were busy, answering that they would come
if the matter were urgent. But the instances of the general of the day
before having been repeated for the reply, it was sent to him in said
letter between seven and eight in the morning of the said day, the
twenty-ninth. But after eleven o&rsquo;clock on the same day, the
general sent his letter of the thirtieth of the same month (which
corresponds to our date of the twenty-ninth) with the message for me
not to bother myself, that that letter was to be signed by myself and
the auditors, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10017" href="#pb10017"
name="pb10017">10017</a>]</span>to whom he sent word that if they did
not do it, he would have them immediately thrown into a galley.
Instantly upon receiving this message they immediately appeared, and
signed the letter together with the archbishop, both the original
letter in English and its translation into Spanish. It was sent to the
said general, and said auditors only gave notice that they had made
their protest before the notary, and that it should not be written at
the foot of said letter, in order that the general might not happen to
see it, if he asked for said original letter. With such fear did they
proceed, but the archbishop showed them the copy of his letter
above-mentioned, in which is manifest his protest with the declaration
of repeating it a thousand times.</p>
<p>54. This point has been treated with prolixity, for besides being
one of the most serious, and one of greatest pain, it has been shifted
and juggled [<i lang="es">adviterado</i>?] variously, blackening
enormously the conduct of the archbishop, even to affirming that it is
evident that he had an understanding with the English for this cession,
in a journal full of false entries and of black impostures, composed by
the fiscal. But God be thanked, that the evidence of this criminal
calumny is false, and the weak apprehensions or inferences on which it
is founded have been clearly dissipated. For what is affirmed is false,
namely, that the cession of the islands had been discussed or made
before October 26, and that letters had been written for their
surrender, as the first council was held on the said day, and the
second on the following day (the twenty-seventh and the twenty-eighth).
On the twenty-ninth, the archbishop made his resolution, and wrote the
rough drafts of said letters with his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>own hand on the
twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth. The statement also is false, namely,
that on the twenty-ninth, said letters were sent with one of the same
date in which the archbishop answered the general ceding the islands.
For these original letters are yet in possession of the secretary of
the assembly, and neither then nor at any time have they been sent or
delivered. So true is this that the commanders having gone&mdash;Draper
on the twelfth of November<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3905src" href=
"#xd27e3905" name="xd27e3905src">36</a> of the past year, and Cornish
on the first of March of the present year, who never asked him for a
letter for the surrender of the islands&mdash;the British government
tried afterwards to get the archbishop to give letters of surrender for
Zebu, Yloylo, and Zamboanga, which he refused and did not give, as
appears from his letters, rejecting the instances of the
above-mentioned British government.</p>
<p>55. Also false is the end of this report, which asserts, not indeed
that it is presumed, but that it is presumed if not proved, that the
archbishop tried to shield himself. Without this protection or shelter,
he made the cession in his letter of the said twenty-ninth day, as is
said above, with the signature of the auditors, which they placed in
the letter of Draper on the thirtieth (in our calendar, the
twenty-ninth), which in view of and after the receipt of that of the
archbishop, the said general sent on that same twenty-ninth day, with
the threatening message that he would send them to the galleys. Only
the constancy of the archbishop can be well inferred. In his protest he
asserts and [<i>MS. worn</i>] to the general in consideration
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>of his threat of the extermination of the city
the lives of many, which did not move the animosity of the auditors for
their signature until they received the personal threat of their own
imprisonment.</p>
<p>56. The ambiguous letter of Draper of the twenty-eighth (in our
calendar, the twenty-seventh), is slight foundation for so gross a
suspicion and its proof; in which he seems to infer that the archbishop
had made the cession, and infers on the other hand, that he was in
condition of acting in regard to the cession. For the letter says that
those who endeavored to persuade him not to make the cession would
answer with their lives. It is a proof of the sincerity of the
archbishop that he showed the said letter in the second council, for if
it contained anything suspicious, or anything by which he would be
discovered to be lacking in application, it would have been very easy
for him to suppress it and return it to the general, in order that the
latter might write another, in which nothing would be understood in
regard to the secret understanding. It is not the mark of a good reason
and less is it Christian to assert so great a crime as proved without
having had any motive. For to such infamies, one is moved either by
self-interest or the expectations of honors, or important posts which
both lacked. For the archbishop had previously stripped himself of all
his few valuables and pectorals, without reserving any; and he was
clothed in the greatest honors and employments with which the powerful
Catholic king can honor a vassal of his in these islands. And only by
depriving himself of this recognition, and of his character as a
Christian and archbishop could he offend so enormously against his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>king and religion because of the expectation or
promise of greater honors in Londres or with the very crown of all
Ynglaterra. Through the mercy of God, the archbishop has not been
abandoned by His divine hand in his right judgment or in the works of
his misery and weakness. Neither does he live so forgetful of <i lang=
"la">quid prodest homini</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3925src" href=
"#xd27e3925" name="xd27e3925src">37</a> etc.</p>
<p>57. The reason of the archbishop not having used said letters which
they falsely affirmed had been delivered, and of the originals being
conserved in the possession of the secretary, was that having been sent
(as he thought they ought first to be sent) to the regular superiors
living in Manila on the thirtieth (the following day) of October, who
[<i>MS. worn</i>] to their most [<i>MS. worn</i>] in the margin to be
understood by it the said original message [<i lang=
"es">cordillera</i>]. The above-mentioned reason having been given, the
rumor spread among the populace that the said letter had been the cause
of the disaster of the alcalde-mayor of Pagsanjan,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e3942src" href="#xd27e3942" name="xd27e3942src">38</a> who was
lanced by the Indians themselves on the gallows. That was mentioned to
the archbishop by a trustworthy and God-fearing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>person who grieved at his carelessness in said
letter.</p>
<p>58. Surprised at this information, the archbishop had the
above-mentioned letter brought into the presence of the said person,
together with the others, and had the secretary read them with their
dates. By their very dates, namely, the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth
of October, it was plain that they could not have occasioned the event
of Pagsanjan which occurred the day before, namely, the twenty-seventh
of the same month. This casualty was made more impossible by the
distance of said village from Manila, which is at the least three
days&rsquo; journey. The legitimate cause of this insurrection and
tyrannical murder of their alcalde was that which appears in the
documents formed of this matter, where it is evident that this cloud of
dust which was raised was no other thing than the racial inconstancy
and disloyalty of the natives of that village and its environs. The
fact that the archbishop had not had any support or reply to the
contents of his letter from the superiors of Manila, and the knowledge
that Auditor Anda had already sent his message [<i lang=
"es">cordillera</i>] through the provinces,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3952src" href="#xd27e3952" name="xd27e3952src">39</a> in which he
declared himself to be governor and captain-general, made it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>necessary for the archbishop not to disturb the
provinces and accede to the times and to the circumstances thereof, and
ordered that none of the said letters be sent. That order was executed
as given and the originals were kept in the possession of the
secretary. That which can have happened, and of which there is frequent
experience in any part, as well as in this city, is that a copy of one
or more of said letters may have been drawn by the infidelity of some
clerk without the archbishop or his secretary being able to remedy it,
and in this way their contents may have become known and explained by
the malicious rivalry in as sinister a manner as is usual.</p>
<p>59. In regard to the other point of the completion of the million,
the archbishop entrusted it to the senior auditor, Don Francisco
Villacorta,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3962src" href="#xd27e3962" name=
"xd27e3962src">40</a> in order that having assembled those interested,
together with the fiscal, they might determine what the matter demanded
according to its circumstances. They held several meetings, in one of
which a plan was adopted for demanding of each person the contribution
in accordance with his wealth and the sack which he had suffered. But
there was great opposition, and some made complaint to General Draper
and to the archbishop. The latter assembling them all, exhorted their
help to the extent possible, to which they were obliged by their
conscience and by the circumstances, in order to avoid greater
extortions. For the representation to the general of not having
promised to complete the million was not received, but this matter was
strongly insisted upon. Finally, the only <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>success achieved was
in getting each one to offer what he deemed best. With the valuables
and money [given], scarce did the sum reach twenty-six thousand pesos.
But a very great quantity was needed to complete the million in
addition to that raised by the pious funds, the chaplaincies, and the
silver of the churches. This reached the sum of four hundred and
forty-three thousand pesos.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3967src" href=
"#xd27e3967" name="xd27e3967src">41</a> However great the effort and
attempt made by the English to have the million paid, yet it was found
impossible on the part of the citizens to raise hastily a greater sum
than that above-mentioned because of the sack and destruction which
they suffered even in their furniture and houses; and because some few,
who could have aided, were not living in the city, but had taken to the
mountains in several places, while some others, as was said, placed
what money they could in safety outside the city, so that the richest
who were absent refused to aid.</p>
<p>60. At this time the two fragatas, which had been assigned by the
enemy, at the time of the siege, to capture the
&ldquo;Philipino,&rdquo; entered the bay with the ship
&ldquo;Trinidad,&rdquo; which they had fought and captured after a
vigorous defense on the twenty-ninth and thirtieth of October. This
ship left for its voyage to Acapulco from the Embocadero under a
favorable wind on September 13, but lost its mast in a severe storm at
a distance of three hundred leguas at the parallel of the Marianas. It
was all but gone, and it became necessary to put back [which was done]
with great difficulty. When it was in the Embocadero near San Jacinto,
without being aware of what was happening in Manila, it was attacked
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>by said two fragatas and captured. From the time
of its arrival, the claim was begun to be made that it was not a
legitimate prize, the freedom of trade, possessions, and property
having been agreed upon in anticipation. And although the instance of
the commerce body was continued to the British government for this
declaration, the government sent it to Admiral Cornish, and the latter
after many delays, and by nature serious, harsh, and hard, because the
Spaniards had not fulfilled the stipulation regarding the millions,
answered that that matter belonged to the admiralty of Londres, whither
it was sent.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3977src" href="#xd27e3977"
name="xd27e3977src">42</a> He would never consent to have the cargo
remain on deposit, or to have it delivered to those interested in it,
under the guaranty which was lastly proposed by the archbishop, he
having previously supported the right of the citizens to its
restitution; for said admiral said that it was no time now to discuss
this matter, as he was just about to sail, and left on the first of
March with his squadron, taking said ship.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3980src" href="#xd27e3980" name="xd27e3980src">43</a></p>
<p>61. Its cargo consisted of one thousand one hundred and forty-eight
piezas, but all that was sent outside of the hold, consisting of boxes
of presents, valuables and things of value, he had placed at auction,
without taking the formality to summon those interested or making any
note of what was taken possession of and seized. Some of the boxes of
letters which were filled with water, and which were seized by them,
they opened and took cognizance of their contents. The archbishop was
unable to get the return <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href=
"#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>of these letters and official
papers, which he demanded repeatedly. For it was well to burn the
private letters, which the enemy themselves declared to be false and
entangling, as they themselves noted. But no one was ignorant of the
many accounts and fabulous stories which were written by several
persons. The archbishop was also unable to obtain some canes which he
was sending&mdash;one for the king, and the other for the prince. Their
distinction was that they were made of fine bamboos of these islands,
and the handles were engraved skilfully with the royal arms by noble
natives of the islands. Neither did [he obtain] the valuables left by
Mariscal Arandia as a legacy to our sovereigns.</p>
<p>62. As the whole business or object of the English was the treasure
of the &ldquo;Philipino&rdquo; they sent two more fragatas to look for
it, and in them went persons authorized by this community. Inasmuch as
four citizens had been made prisoners or detained in houses of this
city, as well as Auditor Don Francisco Villacorta and the fiscal, Don
Francisco Viana, one cannot imagine the efforts of the archbishop,
personally and in writing with the generals and the British government
for the release of the above-mentioned, especially the ministers. After
some days and petitions, he was able to succeed on condition that four
men should be chosen to make the abovesaid efforts. In fact they were
chosen by the citizens and sailed in said fragatas, although they were
unable to make the port of Palapa because of very violent storms which
putting them in danger of shipwreck made it necessary for them to put
back to Manila after ninety days.</p>
<p>63. Seeing that their attempt was frustrated and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>that
the rumors that they heard were that the silver had been removed from
the &ldquo;Philipino,&rdquo; and placed in safety, Admiral Cornish,
irritated and just about to sail, attempted a new sack. Although by
demand of the British government, it appears that he went to quiet his
officers, yet he was implacable, and it appears that having been
advised by the said government that it would resist on its part the
sack within the city, without desisting from his attempt, said admiral
set his gaze on the suburbs, especially on Santa Cruz,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3997src" href="#xd27e3997" name=
"xd27e3997src">44</a> where the most of the Spaniards are. Already were
the dread and consternation great, and the destruction and mortality
which were threatened by the fury of this hostility were feared. The
archbishop, having been notified thereof by some Spaniards, exerted all
his strength and care to avoid this disaster, and moderate, and cause
the admiral to set some bounds [to the matter]. Discussing the matter
with the latter in several visits which he paid to him, he was able to
persuade him and agree to give him an order for the two millions. In
case that the &ldquo;Philipino&rdquo; (as was already inferred) came
with its wealth or the fragata which was assigned for this purpose
transported them, from that property would be completed the amount of
the other two millions, having liquidated the account in regard to the
sum already raised, and taking account of the amount of the sack that
they had suffered and which was to be regulated.</p>
<p>64. In this manner everything remained quiet. It was no time or
season for answer or reply, especially <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>with the admiral who
was so strong and hard in his resolution. No other expedient was found
with which to meet the conflict than the above-mentioned order. Neither
could he avoid in the nearness of his embarkation the new sack of the
church and convent of St. Augustine (with the exception of the
reliquaries which the archbishop, feigning ignorance, had caused to be
kept in the cathedral); nor that the admiral should not sack the houses
of the marquis of Monte Castro and of Don Andres Blanco&mdash;the first
because he had failed in his word of honor, and the second because he
had not taken part in the contribution&mdash;in which were included
various persons who lost their property.</p>
<p>65. The account of the sack which Cornish furnished to the
archbishop is quite ridiculous and improbable as to the amount of
twenty-nine thousand pesos at which he puts it, since by means of the
investigations which the archbishop was able to carry on the sack
amounts to more than eight hundred thousand pesos; and almost one-third
of the inhabitants were absent so that it has been impossible to adjust
their loss through the absence of many persons. However, it is a fact
that the total amount must be lowered by what the Indians and house
servants took in these robberies and destruction. But this adjustment
could not be made at the time when Cornish threatened the new sack; for
these investigations are being made at present, and as yet the last has
not been heard from because of the absence of not a few inhabitants who
have still to make their declaration. Neither would the irritation of
Cornish, had these investigations even been finished, have considered
our account and adjustment, both because of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>impetuous nature, and because of the so vast
discrepancy of his account to that above-mentioned. Consequently, it
was only the time to yield and to enter into some kind of agreement by
means of the above-mentioned order. This recourse was necessary and
inevitable under the circumstances leaving it for the consideration of
our king and his ministers who might take the advisable measures in
view of what had happened.</p>
<p>66. The admiral departed, as has been said, the first of March. He
left orders to his castellan of Cavite to go in a fragata to Palapa. In
fact the latter did so, and through a citizen, who was selected by the
merchant body, the order was given from the beginning for the commander
of the &ldquo;Philipino&rdquo; to bring the silver or deliver it; so
that, having reduced the amount which was lacking to complete the
millions, the remainder might be delivered to the Spaniards interested
and sent to its destination. Already it was more than probable by this
time that the silver of the said ship was placed in safety; and the
above-mentioned castellan, who went to Palapa, found that it was so. He
found the said ship without any crew or any cargo; and notwithstanding
some investigations which he made to get the silver, he ordered the
&ldquo;Philipino&rdquo; to be set afire and returned to Manila without
having obtained anything else than having made his efforts in
vain.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4013src" href="#xd27e4013" name=
"xd27e4013src">45</a> But he did not cease to make all efforts ashore
and by sea in small boats to get the silver, but the same result
followed of not obtaining any success. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span></p>
<p>67. Before these incidents, by others which intervened through the
withdrawal of some Spaniards and officers, notwithstanding their oath
and word of honor, the English caused to enter into the city those who
were suspected, among them being the two ministers who were the only
ones outside the walls, Don Francisco Viana and Don Francisco
Billacorta. The latter effected his entrance into the city on receipt
of the message; and the former his retirement to Pampanga at the end of
January. Auditor Villacorta entered and left the city freely, but had
the heedlessness [to write] certain letters to Auditor Anda, and the
misfortune to have them intercepted. It resulted therefrom that he was
seized and in a very short time he was considered by a council of war,
which sentenced him to the list punishment.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4022src" href="#xd27e4022" name="xd27e4022src">46</a></p>
<p>68. Almost at the same time the rumor spread abroad of the offensive
and defensive alliance of the British government with the king of Jolo.
In consideration of the treaty which that sultan had a few months
previously celebrated in favor of his Majesty and the Spanish nation,
and of the irreparable injuries that would result to these islands from
the newly-contracted alliance, the archbishop had recourse by a very
strong and expressive letter to said government, laying upon it all the
responsibility in regard to said alliance. However, he resisted
strongly for the reason which he expresses in his reply. But this
alliance has reached such a point that the government has sent Prince
Ysrael, son of the said sultan, to Jolo; and then tried to get the
archbishop to give <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253"
name="pb253">253</a>]</span>him a letter for the surrender of
Zeb&ugrave; and other islands,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4032src"
href="#xd27e4032" name="xd27e4032src">47</a> but its petitions and
exigencies to obtain said letter were unsuccessful. The archbishop
refused to give it for the reasons which are expressed in his letters
to the British government on this matter. So far has the archbishop
been from giving letters for the surrender of the islands, that he
refused and resisted what was petitioned from him in instances and even
by threats a long time after the cession had passed.</p>
<p>69. The archbishop excused no effort in the so serious matter of the
cause of Auditor Villacorta, by message, visits, and letter, but all he
could obtain was the suspension of his execution. The British conceded
that on condition that the defendant himself, the father provincial of
the Society, and the archbishop write to Auditor Anda, ordering him to
suspend hostilities, and not to prevent the entrance of food. I have no
doubt that the two letters were couched in good terms. That of the
archbishop was dated March 21, [and was written] with the care and
attention that it expresses. These letters were given to the British
who sent them by the most reverend Father Sierra, a Dominican, who
brought back the answers and placed them in the hands of said British
government. The latter, after a few days, sent his to the archbishop
opened, after having made a copy of it, which was translated into the
English language. Consequently, it was necessary for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>the
archbishop to demand that the said copy be destroyed, as it touched and
blackened his honor.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4039src" href=
"#xd27e4039" name="xd27e4039src">48</a> But the British government did
not comply with this request, and only promised not to let it out of
its possession, except to its superiors. Already the contents of said
letter had been divulged among the Spaniards and English, a fact that
deeply penetrated the heart of the archbishop, for its style and its
contents, alone ought to be buried in profound silence.</p>
<p>70. This letter, of which a rare copy will be found in the
histories, is handed in to the royal hand and most just comprehension
of his Majesty under other covers. The same diligence is practiced in
another letter of the fiscal with his diary and manifesto, all written
in the same ink and formed almost with the same pen as the
above-mentioned letter of the other minister. Both of them have not
been ashamed of staining their pens with blood against the laws of
decency, truth, justice, and charity, to the offense of God, of their
oath of obedience to the laws of the Indias, and in contempt of the
archiepiscopal dignity, and of the archbishop&rsquo;s representation in
these islands of the royal person of his Majesty. By their example they
fermented the people, who have become scattered and corrupted with
scandals, murmurings, disgust, and spite against their own prelate,
pastor and father.</p>
<p>71. This impudence in the village, and almost universal among all
classes of persons and estates, with the exception of some few of
reason and judgment, is the fire that has deeply penetrated the feeling
and pierced the heart of the archbishop. He maintained himself and
still maintains himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href=
"#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>firmly in the face of his enemies,
in order that he might attend to the conflicts and needs of the said
village and of our peoples, and not deprive the city and the many
persons of both sexes who have found it impossible to leave it, of
shelter; to attend, at the same time, to the protection of the churches
as well as possible; and to see that the holy religion and divine
worship are encouraged without commencing to grow weak in the capital.
He has succeeded in doing this in the greater part through the divine
Mercy; and to so great a degree have Church functions and all the
ecclesiastical ministers succeeded for the welfare of the faithful,
that edification and not a little wonder is caused by the fact that the
faith and worship of our Lord Jesus Christ are seen to shine forth in
the midst of so many hardships, conflicts, and necessities.</p>
<p>72. In this the royal favor and protection of the king, our
sovereign, has the greatest and best share. The ecclesiastical cabildo
and its ministers, the girls&rsquo; school of Santa Potenciana, the
troops which were left, the invalid and sick officers in the hospital
of San Juan de Dios, the archbishop and his household, and many others
who are aided by the king&rsquo;s pay, have been able to be maintained
through his generous pity. With all this was concerned the provision
which the archbishop enacted with the British governor in regard to the
supply of the pay which he has administered without fail. In the
regulation of them, the distribution has been made according to the
circumstances of the persons and of the time, with the economy which
has appeared advisable. Of the amount of these salaries, he has given
and will give the orders against his Majesty&rsquo;s treasury,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>on whom depends the subsistence of the
above-mentioned vassals who have only lived and been able to support
themselves with these aids of his Majesty, without having any other
help so far as the human is concerned.</p>
<p>73. But in order that no thorn might be wanting to the archbishop to
pierce him in regard to this same so favorable and equitable provision,
since he assigned therein only half pay to the wearers of the toga (in
consideration of the fact that if they moderated themselves under the
present circumstances, it appeared sufficient, as they no longer
respected his Majesty, reserving for the latter&rsquo;s justification,
the payment of the other half for an opportune time), they were very
angry, and made an outcry against the archbishop in a most impudent
letter, in which they retorted but without foundation and with a
vicious comprehension, that the archbishop was applying to himself more
than half pay, although he took only the half which belongs to him as
governor, and nothing more, not even any stipend as archbishop. But
said ministers requested, and it was given them in its entirety or as a
reward until October five, without them having been willing in the
future to accept the half pay which was assigned to them under the
above-mentioned reasons; and although their right remained safe to them
at all times, it would have demonstrated that they would have been
insufficient had the archbishop changed his provision. But it was shown
that one-half the pay was quite sufficient for a minister to maintain
himself with moderation and economy, as was proved in the case of Don
Pedro Calderon, who arrived at this capital with the captured ship
&ldquo;Trinidad,&rdquo; and who requested that he be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>furnished with half pay under bond. It was
conceded to him in this manner, and he supported himself, daughter, and
household with it.</p>
<p>74. Notwithstanding so many contradictions, conflicts, accidents,
and enemies, on all sides which have undermined the robust health of
the archbishop, placing him in the extremity of dying, he has been
experiencing the most special providence of the Most High. Not without
astonishment do they see him with life and that he has been able to
attend to the conflicts of all and to the continuous attacks which
pressed on him constantly from all sides. There has not been any
Spaniard or native, or people of these, or any religious, who have been
in prison, or experienced hardship, or necessity, whom he has not
helped or protected with the offices of charity, mediation, and
petition with the English, from whom he has many times obtained either
the protection or justice which has been fitting. Consequently, he has
encountered the enemy for all this class of people, even with danger to
the respect of his dignity and of his person. Individual mention of the
cases and persons would be infinite; and much appears in his letters to
the English on various matters. But the gratitude that has been his due
is that of a people made peevish by the wicked leaven of the examples
and inducements of persons, who by their rank and post, special honor,
and greater obligation, and because of being singularly benefited by
the archbishop, ought to be quite other, and, at least, without the
abandon of the fear of God and Christian charity.</p>
<p>75. The inevitable situation in which the archbishop finds himself,
because of being in front of the enemy and in their presence, in order
to attend to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258"
name="pb258">258</a>]</span>various grievous casualties which
frequently occur would become more tolerable to him, if he did not
experience from his own people and from the one who commands them, and
from those whom they incite for the latter, that they have vomited
forth their fury against his person. It seems incredible, but it is a
fact, that the wrath and imprudent acts of the abovesaid who have
soullessly trampled on his dignity have cost him more pangs than the
presence of the enemy, who have respected him, although they have
caused him great mortification.</p>
<p>76. From this fatal experience it comes, that the situado and wealth
of the &ldquo;Philipino&rdquo; having been assured as abovesaid; and
adding that in the same security, in which it is considered, it runs
great danger from the very ones who are guarding it, and from other
evildoers: the archbishop does not dare to ask for it for the help and
pay of those who are supported in the city at the expense of his
Majesty, but continues to ask and receive that help and pay from the
British government, by which the royal treasury is doubly burdened.
This treasure has as yet escaped the hand of the English, but it has
fallen into so many that it is difficult for it to come into the hands
of those interested; for besides its great danger, it is asserted that
the expenses of its conduction, which is not finished as yet as far as
Pampanga, exceed one hundred and twenty [pesos] to the thousand, while
the pay which is distributed with free hand and other expenses are in
excess of thirty thousand pesos per month, as the archbishop has been
assured.</p>
<p>77. It is true that there would be no little difficulty in
conducting these sums, which the archbishop asks, to the city, and that
they would run many dangers; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href=
"#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>but the difficulty from which
Auditor Anda would remove and free himself in its sending is greater
and insuperable. This person, quite filled with wrath against the
archbishop, by his apprehensions as mistaken as exorbitant, and by his
scandalous productions, and who appears to be only trying to make his
conduct and zeal for the royal service shine out by blackening that of
the archbishop, refused to send the despatches of his Majesty, and
those belonging to the archbishop himself, and which had been brought
by the &ldquo;Philipino,&rdquo; although he was ordered to deliver
those that belonged to all the tribunals, [religious] communities, and
private persons. This refusal shows what would happen to any request
for the silver. For if since this retention is opposed to the sovereign
respect of his Majesty, by detaining the orders that he may direct to
the archbishop in his royal decrees, Anda is trampling also upon the
public faith, in what corresponds to the letters, business,
commissions, pious funds, and matters of conscience which may be
concerned in them, it being quite to the prejudice of the government of
the archbishopric and to the public scorn and disrespect of its
pastor.</p>
<p>78. Anda&rsquo;s despatch also in regard to the royal seal made it
necessary for the archbishop to take extreme precaution so that this
royal jewel might not be endangered. This being in the power of the
archbishop, had been conserved in his possession with so great secrecy
without the least fear. But the said instance and procedure of said
open despatch to the vice-chancellor, who was in the house of the
archbishop, in his service, divulged the secret in Pampanga, and to not
few persons of this city. Consequently, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>not without manifest
danger could it be sent, or could it be preserved in the possession in
which it had been, and besides to deliver these royal arms to Anda was
to place them in a cruel hand for the abuse and atrocities which are
experienced, and without it being possible in present affairs to have
their authoritative use, for which they were destined by their
sovereign owner.</p>
<p>79. The many persons who are fed with the silver have gone to
Pampanga, among whom is a considerable number of military
officers&mdash;some in order to get what belongs to them, and others
for the consideration of larger pay, and all of them and all the other
Spaniards incited and threatened by said auditor have been made to
incur the inobservance of their oath and their word of honor. And from
this irregularity and from others of which the cowardice of the fiscal
and his inducements for the same purpose, furnished an example, have
come other disorders and disasters of the enemy who have been irritated
by these proceedings. Never did the archbishop dissuade or induce any
to remain in the city or to leave it, although he well knew that it was
impossible to divert some families and the religious communities, and
much more those of the feminine sex; but all the fatal consequences
that have been mentioned have aided to compress the spirit of the
archbishop, who by the singular blessing of God has been able to live
and remedy some of the fatalities.</p>
<p>80. He considered nothing more necessary than to petition for mail
posts and opportunity to give account of everything to his Majesty,
from whose Catholic zeal alone can one hope for the remedy, unless the
divine Providence miraculously clears the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>way just as is asked
from Him, without believing that it is to tempt God, through the most
extreme necessities in most important matters, and of His divine
service, which intervene and are contained in the present conflicts.
And the efforts dictated by the archbishop&rsquo;s prudence and
obligation, such as giving a report to his king by two posts, doubling
the despatches in the last, by which there comes to be a fourth post,
must not be omitted.</p>
<p>The first was in December, when the engineer, Don Miguel Gomez, was
sent, who was equipped as well as possible. The second was in March of
the present year, by equipping two officers, Don Christoval R&ograve;s,
and Don Andres de la Torre; and at the same time in another English
fragata with sufficient safety and prudent security. He duplicated the
despatches in two English fragatas, addressed to his agent at
Cadiz.</p>
<p>81. These are the most important occurrences during the time of the
siege, and the period following it. Both the other occurrences previous

the military defense of the archipelago; &hellip; his calm submission
to whatever the English advised, even in matters which were clearly
opposed to the integrity and interests of Spain; and other inexplicable
acts: &hellip; give an exact idea of the capacity and character of the
unfortunate one who had the misfortune to exercise a command in such
anxious times, for which he lacked the intelligence, valor, and the

death of Governor Arand&iacute;a, June 1759, the government <i lang=
"la">ad interim</i> was assumed by Miguel Lino de Espeleta, bishop of
Ceb&uacute;. When Rojo took possession of the archiepiscopal see, July
22, 1759, he claimed that the government belonged to him. The auditors
Villacorta and Galb&aacute;n voted for Espeleta, and Calderon and
D&aacute;vila for Rojo. Espeleta, however, was backed by the troops,
and the matter was accordingly decided in his favor. His first measure
was the repeal of the celebrated ordinances of good government compiled
by Arand&iacute;a. His next step was the prosecution of Santiago
Orenda&iacute;n, the favorite of Arand&iacute;a, as he believed him to
be the originator of the regulations contrary to the religious, charge
of the prosecution being given to Auditor Villacorta. Orenda&iacute;n
took refuge in the Augustinian convent at Tondo, but was given up and
lodged in the fort of Santiago. Escaping thence, he was received into
the Recollect convent, whence he was taken by soldiers. The matter
stirred up the opposing forces, and excommunications followed in rapid
succession on both sides, the two auditors, Calderon and D&aacute;vila
being among those excommunicated. The matter was quashed by the
archbishop upon the arrival of a royal decree appointing him governor
<i lang="la">ad interim</i> (July, 1761). Orenda&iacute;n was liberated
and the records of the case sent to Madrid. See Montero y Vidal, ii.

&ldquo;The most singular of these imposts, however, is the Crusade. It
was born in the ages of folly and fanaticism during which millions of
Europeans set forth to wear themselves out in the East for the recovery
of Palestine. The court of Rome revived it in favor of Ferdinand, who
in 1509 undertook to wage war against the Moors of Africa. It still
exists in Spain, where it is never less than 12 sols 6 deniers, or more
than 4 livres. One pays more dearly for it in the New World, where it
is collected only once in two years, and where it rises from 35 sols to
13 livres, according to the rank and fortune of the citizens. For this
sum, people obtained the liberty of being absolved by their confessors
from crimes reserved to [the cognizance of the] pope and the bishops;
the right to use on days of abstinence certain forbidden articles of
food; and a multitude of indulgences for sins already committed or
which might be committed. The government did not strictly oblige its
subjects to take this bull, but the priests refused the consolations of
religion to those who neglected or disdained it; and perhaps there is
not in all Spanish America a man sufficiently courageous or enlightened
to brave this ecclesiastical censure.&rdquo; (Raynal, <i lang=

According to manuscript maps in the archives of the Indies, at Seville,

the pilot Francisco Xavier Estorgo, of 1770, the bastion of Carranza is
another name for the bastion of San Andr&eacute;s. An Irish pilot named

council held on the third of October, it was proposed that the women,
children, and aged be sent out of Manila. It was also proposed that the
governor, courts, and most of the citizens withdraw, leaving the city
in charge of a leader with instructions for its defense or surrender.
The fiscal recommended system and order in the matter of provisions and
supplies, and the advisability of assigning pay to the Indians. But no
decided action was taken as many disputes marked the council. The
religious were, however, urged to look after the Indians, and aid in
the defense of the walls, being permitted in case the city was
indefensible, to capitulate, as well as to spike the cannon. Reports of
this council, and the ones held on October 26 and 27, and the reply of
the officials to the archbishop on October 23, are to be found in an

had never seen war like this, and now saw with their own eyes the
effects of it, namely, the change of government, the cowardice of the
Castilians, and the complete upheaval of order, they were caused great
surprise, and thought that the end of the world was come. Consequently,
most of them, that is, the herd, not all, began to commit thefts and to
commit assaults on the highway, committing many murders, rapes, and
other outrages, as is usual on these occasions; especially those who
had been imprisoned in the jails for crime, to whom liberty was given

Augustinian fathers were imprisoned in their convent, although they
were permitted to leave it at times provided it should be within the
city. Suddenly a counter order was given and they were deprived of that
permission. It was believed that the English were making such
demonstrations in order that the Augustinians might surrender to them
the silver that they had hidden. But since the procurator was firm in
not revealing it, they were treated as traitors because their brothers
favored the side of Anda. The English collected religious to the number
of twelve, and embarked them to take them to Europa. One of them was
released at the request of the archbishop. After the fathers had
embarked, the English entered their convent and sacked it, so that
nothing was left in it. They found six thousand pesos of coined silver
which had been hidden in a garden, and the wrought silver which had
been concealed when the question of paying the million was discussed.

together with the perquisites of the office and the aid that he would

accompanied him, and although pursued by mounted Sepoys, was not
overtaken. Joining Anda, he became the real military arm of the
opposition. At an estate held by the Jesuits in Mariquina, and where he
was aided by the Jesuits, he urged the natives to resist British rule,
being followed by the majority of them, whereupon he was able to attack
and punish some of the ladrones of the region. He obtained many
advantages by fighting in guerrila fashion. When Anda finally entered

Anda&rsquo;s force, says Le Gentil (ii, p. 262) consisted of about
9,000 men, of whom 2,000 were armed with muskets, and about 300
Europeans, most of whom were French deserters from the British. To such
an extent did the desertion of the French occur that the British sent
those left them (about 150) back to India. Anda refused the offer of a
French sergeant to endeavor to cause the desertion of the Sepoys, on
the ground that they were Mahometans. Anda&rsquo;s force, before he
surrendered the command to Francisco de la Torre, is specified by
Ayerbe (<i lang="es">Sitio y conquista</i>, pp. 132, 133), as follows:
12 infantry companies, consisting of 1,370 men, of whom 223 were

of whom 100 were Spaniards, and the rest Cagayans, and 50 of whom had
muskets, 50 blunderbusses, and the rest spears; 100 cavalry dragoons;
281 artillerymen, some of them deserters, most armed with sabers, and a
few with muskets; 100 Indians commanded by the native colonel, Santos
de los Angeles. 60 being infantry with muskets, and 40 cavalry with
short firearms and spears; 300 native and mestizo commissary troops
armed with muskets and bows and arrows, whose duty it was to prevent
the entrance of food into Manila; 3 Boholans, armed with lance and
shield, who acted as Anda&rsquo;s bodyguard; 400 Visayans, armed with
bows and arrows; 2,000 Indians, enlisted in the villages near Polo, as
a reserve; in addition to the natives used in other employments. Le
Gentil (ii, pp. 266&ndash;268) accuses Anda of inaction, although he
had an army of more than 10,000 men. But he adds that Anda could not
count on his native troops, and had no large guns.&nbsp;<a class=

letter written by the archbishop on October 29, to the provincials of
the religious orders. His own sins he fears have been the cause of the
loss of Manila and other places. But God has been merciful in much, and
liberty, trade, and religion are preserved for the inhabitants. An
attempt is being made to collect the one million of the ransom money
demanded, and the rest will be taken from the &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo;
and bills of credit on the Spanish monarch. It is necessary to cede the
islands because of the force of the enemy in order to avoid greater
misfortune. This cession is merely a temporary deposit made to the
British sovereign. The aid of the religious is asked in preserving
order and the statu quo, by not opposing the British.&nbsp;<a class=

of the letter written by the archbishop to Draper under date of October
29, 1762, and translated from the Latin, in which it was couched, into
Spanish, is contained in a MS. owned by Edward E. Ayer. The archbishop
servilely addresses Draper as &ldquo;Prudent and most clement
conqueror,&rdquo; and &ldquo;most humane sir.&rdquo; The inhabitants
are doing their best to gather the million demanded at once, and the
archbishop has given all the silver of his church (except what is
absolutely necessary for the sacrifice of the mass) and even his
pectorals. He bewails the fate that makes it necessary for him to cede
the islands to the English. Draper&rsquo;s letter on the twenty-seventh
(twenty-eighth, English calendar) of October follows this, although it
should properly precede it. It dwells on the humanity of the English,
and the fact that by the cession of a few places, the archbishop has
avoided much ruin, for the English arms would easily have reduced them;
and the inhabitants have been left freedom of worship, trade, their
possessions, churches, and convents. Those who persuade the archbishop
through a false sense of honor not to cede the islands will be
responsible for the consequences. The auditors are to immediately sign
the cession. The cession signed on the thirtieth (English date) is as
follows: &ldquo;Sir: All the islands subordinate to that of Luzon, of
which Manila is the capital (in the manner and form at present under
the dominion of his Catholic Majesty) are to be ceded to his Britannic
Majesty. The latter is to be the recognized sovereign until the peace
between both kings decides their fate. Their religion, goods,
privileges, possessions, and trade are to be conserved to the subjects
of Espa&ntilde;a who inhabit these islands, in the same manner that
they have been conserved for the inhabitants of Manila and on the
island of Luzon. All the alcaldes, governors, and military men shall
enjoy the honors of war if they give their word of honor not to serve
or bear arms against his Britannic Majesty during this war. The
archbishop and auditors shall sign this agreement. [Signed] Guillermo
Draper.&rdquo; It is to be noted that the archbishop&rsquo;s synopses

letters themselves.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Augustinian provincial with one of his own, asking him to conserve
Spanish interests as much as possible, and to enrol the aid of the
natives. An order promulgated by Anda, October 6, 1762, enjoins
watchfulness on the part of the alcaldes-mayor. They are to forbid all
passage to Manila, both of persons and supplies; are to deny all aid to
the British and all strangers in their jurisdiction; and are to arrest
or kill all suspects. See Vivar&rsquo;s <i lang=

<h2 class="main">SYNOPSIS OF LETTER FROM ANDA TO CARLOS III</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">June 22, 1764, Don Simon Anda y Salazar sent a letter
to the king, in which he showed the measures adopted by him during or
in the time of the war with the English, in regard to economic matters
of police and public order. They were as follows.</p>
<p>In regard to the fact that prices for provisions, which had become
dear because of the English invasion, should be fixed at the prices
regulated by custom and tariff, as well as the freight duties of the
craft, day wages of stevedores, rent of beasts of burden, and wages of
rowers, it was ordered that a tariff be formed in the provinces of
Bulacan and Pampanga, as they had none.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4094src" href="#xd27e4094" name="xd27e4094src">1</a></p>
<p>[The tariff was ordered] so that the coins of two and one-half
tomins, one and one-half tomins, diminished by waste, from the value of
their stamp, might be received at their intrinsic value; in order that
in a determined time, the Sangleys might present themselves under
penalty of two hundred lashes, and confiscation of their property, as
it was learned that many of the dwellers in the Pari&aacute;n of Manila
had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>entered Pampanga, and had united with those who
resided in the villages of the province, and were preparing arms. The
object was to disarm them and send them to the Pari&aacute;n. But many
of them presented themselves armed and offered to give bonds that they
were peaceful and that their arms were employed in the service of his
Majesty.</p>
<p>He ascertained that the agreement that they had made with the
English was that one thousand Chinese should enter from the
Pari&aacute;n of Manila, and distribute themselves through the
villages, so that they might fire them at that hour of Christmas eve
when the natives should be in the temples, in order that by reason of
the confusion, free entrance into the province might be secured for the
English. He proceeded to imprison and punish many of them, and gave
orders to maintain a suitable guard at the entrances of the bars and
villages from the twenty-third to the twenty-fifth of December, 1762;
and the religious ministers of the doctrine were not to open their
churches or celebrate the divine offices, and to act with all manner of
precaution.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Chinese aided the English in their expeditions, and
that the chief Sangleys were censuring such conduct as well as that of
others of those who plotted the insurrection in Pampanga, he suddenly
pardoned them on condition that they would not reside in the provinces
without license from the governing Audiencia, not to reside [there]
longer than the time he would set, pay a tribute, and not carry food or
aid the enemy.</p>
<p>Some submitted, but acted deceitfully, introducing false barrillas
into the villages, withdrawing the pesos, giving information to the
enemy, and going <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264"
name="pb264">264</a>]</span>freely from the Pari&aacute;n of Manila to
the provinces.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4109src" href="#xd27e4109"
name="xd27e4109src">2</a> Others aided the English and supplied them
with food. Consequently, it was ordered that the alcaldes-mayor should
form a list of the Sangleys, of their provinces, prohibiting their
admission unless they had permission from the Audiencia. No one of them
was to go from the provinces to Manila and Cavite, under penalty of the
confiscation of his property. That checked their insolence in large
part, it is said.</p>
<p>He ordered the arms collected for the use of the soldiers.</p>
<p>He forbade more wine than was necessary to be taken from the
province of Laguna, because of the disorders produced by drunkenness.
In Bacolor the sale of nipa wine was by retail.</p>
<p>He ordered the soldiers who had dispersed when the capture of Manila
and Cavite by the English took place to present themselves. They did
so, as did also the officers, showing the arms that they
possessed.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4124src" href="#xd27e4124" name=
"xd27e4124src">3</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265"
name="pb265">265</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the province of Pampanga, he permitted the free circulation of
the barrillas (money made of pinchbeck and tin which the ayuntamiento
of Manila coined for purchase at retail, and whose value was that of
one grano of a tomin), but since the Sangleys introduced many
counterfeit ones, he had to prohibit their circulation.</p>
<p>He ordered Don Francisco Javier Salgado to investigate the
extortions and losses caused in the villages of Tondo and Cavite by the
militia of Laguna and Tayabas who were assigned to oppose the English,
because the leaders of such militia could not make them observe the due
subordination. But no injured one presented himself, and accordingly he
says that there is no one against whom to proceed, in spite of the fact
that the order was published by edict.</p>
<p>He published an edict in regard to weights and measures, in order
that they might not be made less or clipped.</p>
<p>He forbade the seculars who had fled to the provinces to obey the
summons of the archbishop that they return to Manila.</p>
<p>He ordered the Indians not to go out of their villages without a
passport from the gobernadorcillo to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb266" href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>villages within the
province; and from the governing Audiencia to Manila and its environs,
so that they might not carry provisions to Manila.</p>
<p>That order not being sufficient, he issued other edicts making the
prohibition more strict especially against the Spaniards.</p>
<p>Having seen that the four churches that were under the cannon of the
fort of Manila had been used by the English as fortifications, who
committed all manner of profanations, he ordered the necessary
arrangements to be made in the villages to burn them, if the enemy
attacked.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4147src" href="#xd27e4147" name=
"xd27e4147src">4</a> That order poorly understood, exposed the church
of Vi&ntilde;an<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4150src" href="#xd27e4150"
name="xd27e4150src">5</a> to being unnecessarily burned, but it was
saved by order of Anda. He also censured the first provision which he
had to revoke.</p>
<p>He prosecuted and punished several spies sent by the English to
ascertain what Anda and the loyal troops were doing.</p>
<p>He permitted free trade among the provinces, so that they might have
food in abundance. He ordered that all the lands of Pampanga be
planted, so far as possible, with rice, sugarcane, etc., and that land
in the village of San Ysidro be given to the Tag&aacute;logs who had
fled from Manila.</p>
<p>He arranged that the food for the provision of the warehouses be
bought by the parish priests, and that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>they be paid in cash
instead of demanding them through apportionment.</p>
<p>He went out to defend the loyal troops who were maltreated and
insulted by the English generals who treated them like dogs. He offered
ten thousand pesos for the heads of Drak, Esmith, and Broche.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4163src" href="#xd27e4163" name=
"xd27e4163src">6</a></p>
<p>He granted general exemption from tribute, polos, and personal
services, in view of the fact that the English said that they had gone
to the islands to free the people from them, which measure proved very
useful.</p>
<p>He ordered that in Bacolor and surrounding villages, the bell be
rung at nine o&rsquo;clock at night for all people to retire, and not
to be seen on the streets, in order to avoid disorders.</p>
<p>He forbade the sending of skins to Manila in order that the English
and Chinese might not use them.</p>
<p>[He forbade] illuminations at night, on the eve and day of the
anniversary of birth and the saint&rsquo;s day of the king and prince
of Asturias.</p>
<p>He prohibited by edict the Pangasinans from living with their herds
on the lands of San Ysidro in order to avoid disorders with the
inhabitants of the village over the pastures.</p>
<p>He prohibited games of dice, cockfighting, and cards, in order to
avoid the excessive thefts and robberies that were committed. He
ordered whoever committed a theft of the sum of one peso to be punished
with the capital penalty.</p>
<p>He published a judicial defense in reply to the considerations of
father Fray Antonio de las Huertas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>of the Order of the
Preachers, to a memorial which was presented in the royal Council of
the Yndias by Father Luis de Morales, of the Society of Jesus,
provincial of his order for the province of Filipinas.</p>
<p>Father Pedro de Espinar of the Society of Jesus, provincial general
of his order for the provinces of Yndias in Madrid, is the author of
the memorial.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4187src" href="#xd27e4187"
name="xd27e4187src">7</a></p>
<p>It is the defense of the Society of Jesus against the writings of
the archbishop of Manila, Pardo, and his partisans, published in
Madrid, and the Roman court, which attributed to the Jesuits complicity
in the questions aroused by the governor of Filipinas and the
Audiencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4201src" href="#xd27e4201" name=

(iv, p. 638, note) has the following from a contemporary MS.:
&ldquo;But the most celebrated and comical, was the disappearance of
one hundred and thirty-five American soldiers, who by means of a rare
stratagem deceived the vigilance of an English company which was
guarding them in the castle of San Fernando or the alcaicer&iacute;a of
the Chinese. In order that they might succeed in their projected
attempt, they mined a bit of land as far as the outlet of the
guardhouse, and then asked for permission to enact a farce. Their
request was granted without any difficulty, and on the day assigned for
the representation, the one who took the part of the comedian began to
make his conclusion while the others were going out of the mine.
Finally the comedian concluded by saying that he was going to call his
companions, and went away to where they had escaped. When the sentinels
saw that they delayed in coming, suspecting what had really happened,
they searched the place where the actors ought to have been. But the
latter were already outside of Tondo, and immediately joined a company
which Anda, previously notified of the project, had sent them. On
account of this jest the English were greatly ashamed, and although
they were angry at the occurrence, yet they praised the ingenious
stratagem.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<h2 class="main">LETTER FROM ANDA TO CARLOS III</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first salute">Sire:</p>
<p>This capital having been taken by assault, October 5, 62; your
archbishop-governor, auditors, troops, and citizens having been made
prisoners; the fort of Santiago and port of Cavite having been
surrendered; all the islands having been ceded afterwards, and four
millions of pesos; and the city having been sacked with the greatest
severity for the space of forty-eight hours: I having declared myself
that same day, in the province of Bulacan, where I was, as royal
Audiencia, governor, and captain-general of said islands, in accordance
with the law, very great was the effort of your archbishop to efface
this image of your Majesty which had remained in these islands,
represented, although unworthily, in my person. In order to show that
more conclusively, I enclose his own manifest letters with the
testimony. Those letters gave motive to this your royal governing
Audiencia to form an informatory process from them of pure and naked
fact, in order to instruct your royal mind. I shall not refer to them
<i lang="la">in extenso</i> in this my representation which is directed
to your Majesty. Upon examining them, will you please state which of
the two proceeded more in accordance with right, law, and religion, to
the love and fidelity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href=
"#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>which each one owes his sovereign
as a good vassal: the reverend archbishop, who tried by so many
methods, to cast to the earth this legitimate image which represented
and defended your royal rights, even to the point of declaring him a
traitor, rebel, and disobedient to his own sovereign, and to that of
Gran Breta&ntilde;a; or I, who suffering and enduring all these things,
made use of your royal power, insulted and abased by so many enemies
and traitors, by making you truly recognized again in these vacillating
fields of Christianity, until you became the terror of all the many
enemies who had declared against you, reducing the greatest and most
principal from a victorious conqueror to a truly starving prisoner. For
the latter did not even have more than nor even as much as the balance
of the cannon of the fort which he occupied, a limit set for his
soldiers under pain of losing life if they went beyond it.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4217src" href="#xd27e4217" name="xd27e4217src">1</a>
Thus did I redeem not only the relief and liberty of this most
afflicted community and its environs, but what is more yet, its wealth
and the most principal thing, the religion and the honor due your
Majesty, which being so exposed seemed about to be entirely lost.</p>
<p>I protest, Sire, that whatever I say in this my representation and
advance in my treatise, is not for the purpose of injuring that
venerable prelate whom I have ever regarded with the respect due the
prince of the Church; and if I transgress in any way, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>do
not express myself with that moderation suitable, I protest that my
words may not serve as an offense to his dignity, and that I have been
actuated in this by only a real affection, with the desire that your
Majesty may be informed of the acts of turbulence which have occurred
in these domains, in order that you may better provide for the best
government and relief of them.</p>
<p>So far as I am concerned, I claim or desire no other satisfaction
than what I have in this as I have desired to serve your Majesty, since
the greatest satisfaction is for your royal piety to consider itself as
well served by me if you find it consistent.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4226src" href="#xd27e4226" name="xd27e4226src">2</a> But if it
should appear to your supreme comprehension that the so public excesses
of your reverend archbishop, as appear from the said testimony, of
which I shall enclose some here, merit satisfaction, this alone
concerns your Majesty.</p>
<p>I am unaware as to the motives of said prelate, that made him,
although it had no bearing on the end, for which he despatched me from
the fort, and so to the injury of your Majesty&rsquo;s interests, when
finding himself a prisoner of war with my associates, order me in a
letter of October 10, 62, among other things: &ldquo;<i>to observe
faithfully the treaties which were being arranged with the British
chiefs in Manila</i>.&rdquo; Although I answered him from the province
of Bulacan in the most courteous and fitting terms, this was not
sufficient to restrain his pen, and on the twenty-sixth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>of
the same month he wrote me pouring out instead of ink, blood and rage
against my loyal procedure.</p>
<p>In the so great consternation in which the loss of Manila placed
your vassals, and for this reason many of the criminal class having
fled from prison, and continuing their depraved morals, they threw into
disorder the environs of this city and its immediate villages. Your
reverend archbishop did not allow the perverse Orendain and Don Cesar
Fallet<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4238src" href="#xd27e4238" name=
"xd27e4238src">3</a> the declared enemies of your Majesty, to stir from
his side. They, availing themselves of the disturbances caused by these
malevolent persons, painted those disturbances to his Excellency,
saying that there was sedition and unrest among all the Indians, who,
having conspired against the Spaniards, were persecuting them as wild
beasts; that already in one province one of them had elevated himself
as emperor and refused obedience to your Majesty; that the province of
Bulacan was in the same condition; that all the others would follow
their example; that one of these days they would have Se&ntilde;or Anda
tied up, if they did not first deprive him of life; that consequently,
as it was advisable to the services of both Majesties and for the
public quiet, and so that so much Christian blood might not be shed,
his Excellency ought to yield all the islands, and cause Se&ntilde;or
Anda to descend; that if he did not condescend to do so, nothing else
would result than the ruin of all these domains, the loss of
Christianity, and the execution by the English of the sentence that had
been pronounced of putting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href=
"#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>to the sword all the Spaniards;
that your Majesty would never be able to consider yourself as well
served; and that consequently he should have a regard to his
conscience.</p>
<p>I understand well, Sire, how if he considered all those motives, and
that from them would follow the total ruin of these islands, he should
then on that account have condescended to redeem them [from ruin] by
ceding them, in regard to the fact that this could not be of any
service to the English, since it only concerns your Majesty. But to
give credit to these two traitors, who knowingly exaggerated these
disturbances to him, and not to proceed, with more knowledge, to write
me in place of the letters ordering the Spaniards to descend, to inform
him regarding the condition of the provinces, and advise me, for my
course, of what was happening in Manila, by directing prudently so
glorious an end after the twenty odd days that the fort had been taken;
and continuing the obligation to surrender these domains with the
tenacity which his above-cited letters show, (although the most of the
suggestions of the two traitors were now seen to be false, as the
provinces were quiet), he proceeded to sign the cession, and even after
seeing the Catholic arms so flourishing and powerful, whose victories,
patent to all the world, were incredible to his Excellency, yet he
prosecuted this undertaking even to the grave.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4245src" href="#xd27e4245" name="xd27e4245src">4</a> In truth,
Sire, I do not know what apology that venerable prelate can give your
Majesty for such actions.</p>
<p>In view of an anonymous letter which your royal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>Audiencia received in Bulacan, in regard to the
English having offered a reward to whomever would take them my head,
and other methods, in which apparently the reverend archbishop was
prudently walking, I despatched to this latter a request and petition
asking him to abstain from such procedures and not to summon the
alcaldes, natives, or Spaniards who had retired, both because his
powers had expired, and because although he did possess such powers,
they ought to be used to the benefit of your Majesty, and not in
opposition to you. But this did not even restrain him in the idea that
had taken possession of him, since already from the twenty-third day,
he had ordered me to descend to Manila, and although he saw my
resistance in my accommodating myself to his ideas, which were so
opposed to your royal rights, he wrote me lastly on the fourth of
November in the terms that his said letter shows,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4252src" href="#xd27e4252" name="xd27e4252src">5</a> and which I
myself am ashamed to mention, referring myself to the enclosed
testimony.</p>
<p>He ordered the alcalde-mayor of Bulacan, Don Jos&eacute; Pasarin,
who recognized me from the first as your royal Audiencia, to cause all
the Spaniards and their families to descend to Manila, even threatening
him with censures if he did not obey. This order included among the
Spaniards my assembly secretary, my advocate, my fiscal, and Doctor Don
Domingo Ara&ntilde;az,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4260src" href=
"#xd27e4260" name="xd27e4260src">6</a> one of the advocates of this
city. But neither they nor said alcalde-mayor, recognizing the very
great service which was being done for his Majesty and for religion in
[not] consenting to the ideas of the reverend archbishop to deprive me
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>those whom I considered capable of some aid in
sustaining the weak remnants of your Majesty&rsquo;s adherents, would
pay any attention [to the order]. On the contrary, they were the ones,
who with my attendants accompanied me in all my labors, and formed my
only consolation in the total abandonment and persecution which I
suffered during the first six months. For all the other Spaniards who
were in that province, carried away either by these persuasions, or
through their terror and the threats of the enemy, or from seeing the
many atrocities committed by the Indians against them through some
trouble that they had had with them, at the most, I am sure, by their
natural inclination to live according to their own wishes, or for the
reason of the party of your Majesty being so few in numbers, went down,
and some with their possessions, to render obedience to the
English.</p>
<p>He ordered the marquis of Monte Castro to return to Manila; and Don
Andres Blanco, who could not do so through his indisposition, to send
his son, availing himself, in order to oblige them the more, of the
expressions which may be seen in the letters of testimony which are
worth your Majesty&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>He wrote in terms apparently so Christian to the provincials of the
Franciscan and Recollect orders, and recognizing himself as the
greatest sinner, confesses that he alone is the cause of all these
misfortunes and that God is punishing his flock for his sins.</p>
<p>Anyone would believe, in view of this so simple understanding of
himself, and a so clear confession of his defects, that it was a true
repentance and grief at seeing the miseries and havoc from which this
city and its environs were suffering, in spiritual and temporal
matters. But it is not so, Sire, for at the same <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>time, he sends pastoral letters to said
provincials, for the Indians of their provinces, in which, with the
greatest simulated virtue, and pretending the greatest advantages to
your royal rights, he persuades them to become subject to the English.
For that purpose he sings a thousand praises of this nation but for the
purpose of surprising the incautious simplicity of these silly Indians,
for whom he had said letters translated into their languages in order
that the poison which they held might work effects more favorable to
his ideas.</p>
<p>Neither the threats of the enemy, nor the ostentation which this one
made of his power, nor the alliance of the apostate Sangleys, declared
in his favor and against your Majesty, nor the abandonment in which I
remained because of the absence of the few Spaniards, who were in the
provinces, nor the endurance of which I made use to dissimulate many
things which I heard and saw among these poor miserable Indians for
want of instruction, education, and communication with civilized
people, nor the schisms and rebellion of some provinces: none of these
things, Sire, was so keenly felt by me as the acts of the reverend
archbishop, which were so irregular and far from the truth; of a
prelate, who instead of furnishing an example, served as a stimulus to
the traitors who leaning on the authority which is represented among
such lofty subjects, were confident of the virtue and zeal of this
prelate, only to become inflamed against me and avail themselves of his
destructive ideas of this your state and religion.</p>
<p>It is left for the supreme intelligence of your Majesty to consider
the great grief caused this royal Audiencia which was governing, to see
an ecclesiastical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277"
name="pb277">277</a>]</span>prelate who had just been military and
political head, who spared no means in order to sacrifice these your
domains, which he ought to have conserved for so many reasons, or at
least have maintained an indifferent attitude in the condition of
prisoner.</p>
<p>What Catholic and loyal vassal of your Majesty could see without
great grief a pastor persuading his sheep in said letters that they
should submit to Gran Breta&ntilde;a? Further on, he says: &ldquo;<i>If
you do as I exhort and advise you, you will receive the reward from
God, and for the contrary, the punishment; and if you observe, this,
you will be good vassals of my king and my faithful
children</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In truth, Sire, such propositions in writing from an ecclesiastical
prelate are of the greatest scandal for the community and very
suspicious for the faith due to both Majesties.</p>
<p>What doctrine, what religion is this, in which one sees that a
pastor, so repentant and full of grief for the troubles of his flock in
the power of the heretical enemy, at the same time, with so efficacious
and mild words induces those who are free to surrender to the same
enemy! That is the same as to deliver them to the wolf so that that
animal may tear them to pieces, and destroy them with the same
hardships which he bewails in the others. To recognize a sin, to
confess it with show of repentance and to commit a greater of the same
kind: what doctrine, I repeat, is this?</p>
<p>A rare thing, the eagerness with which this reverend prelate
undertook and prosecuted a matter so extraordinary and harmful! A good
proof of this truth is what results from the above-cited letters
written to the subjects abovesaid, and which are expressed in the said
testimony which I enclose. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278"
href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>archbishop signs some <i>as
governor of Manila, although a prisoner</i>; in others as governor and
captain-general; and in others, he adds, &ldquo;<i>of these
islands</i>.&rdquo; But if these islands had been already ceded to the
enemy, and that surrender had been made, who could commit a greater
incongruity than to call himself governor of what he had already lost,
since he surrendered and ceded it to the English?</p>
<p>The letter which he writes to the Marquis of Monte Castro begins
thus: &ldquo;<i>Yesterday afternoon, the present governor of Manila and
his council imprisoned</i>, etc., <i>Manuel Antonio,
archbishop-governor</i>.&rdquo; Consequently, at one and the same time
we have three governors&mdash;the Englishman, recognized by the
archbishop; the latter, for thus he signed; and myself, because your
Majesty gave me that post by your laws.</p>
<p>Whether the honors of such post ought or ought not to be kept for
him does not serve as an excuse to the reverend archbishop; or that he
had hopes of again holding such office by the right of postliminy: for
this at most does not go beyond honors, and hopes are kept without in
any way becoming real, for this office was confirmed in me already by
virtue of laws lvii and lviii, book ii, t&iacute;tulo xv of the
<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4315src" href="#xd27e4315" name="xd27e4315src">7</a> and even
according to the first, by the right of postliminy, the reverend
archbishop had no right to administer that office, again, since it
orders expressly that when your royal Audiencia assumes the office, it
hold it until your Majesty appoints to it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4321src" href="#xd27e4321" name="xd27e4321src">8</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span></p>
<p>The fact is that in the despatches sent by the English to the
traitor Diego Silang to Ylocos, and in the edicts which they published,
when they name the reverend archbishop, they say
&ldquo;ex-governor.&rdquo; How could it be otherwise, as he was in the
domains of the king of Ynglaterra, and was not the one appointed by the
latter, and their governor would be opposed to your Majesty. That was
the manner of procedure in regard to the title, until his burial. He
performed judicial acts by means of the false secretary Monrroy and
others in whatever he thought best, with the most special circumstance
that he was always in favor of the English and opposed to the rights of
your Majesty and your vassals.</p>
<p>And hence it is seen that although the English treated him with the
greatest contempt, and confessed that I was acting as a loyal vassal of
your Majesty, he would never relinquish the title of governor, or
recognize in me your royal Audiencia, in accordance with the laws; and
he died in the same conviction, as one may see by his last will, when
he left to the governor, who should come from Espa&ntilde;a, a carriage
and its horses, so that he might make use of it, and ordered this
cabildo to deliver to the same a sealed box, containing the papers,
which were to be sent to your <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280"
href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>Majesty. Thus was it done
without any mention of me, except to persecute me, as if I were not
governor in your Majesty&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Of this fact and others, my successor, Don Francisco Javier de la
Torre, will give account. The latter brought to the royal assembly the
measure in regard to your royal seal which was melted by order of the
archbishop, who always refused to send it to your royal Audiencia. And
although I petitioned it from him in my first letter of October 20, 62,
and there followed in regard to it a measure on which I report
separately in so far as it concerns me, the pretext that is inferred
because of such a demonstration with this so estimable jewel of your
Majesty is surprising; and it is surprising to say that he executed it
because of its difficulty in the gates of the city and the risk which
it ran of falling into the hands of the enemy. However, it is a fact
that there was no danger at all. For when I petitioned it of him, I
told him that he could deliver it to the person who carried my letter,
a man in whom I had complete confidence. Besides he could have sent it
safely by the religious whom the English used as their ambassadors to
me, or by the adjutant whom the reverend archbishop himself sent to me
to inform me of the suspension of hostilities. But since his intention
was no other than to deprive this your image of whatever rights could
represent it, legitimately and truly, on that account it was more
difficult for him to send the royal seal of so little bulk than to me
the withdrawal from the fort of the sum of more than one hundred
thousand pesos of property which your Majesty needed for your troops,
and which I placed in the royal storehouses of those provinces.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>It appears that the disrespect committed toward so sacred a jewel in
which your Majesty is immediately represented, cannot be greater, and
it would surely have been treated with more honor if it had fallen into
the hands of the enemy. This fact is sufficient to confirm the
persecution that was declared, by which he aimed to erase your royal
name from these domains. For in truth, what other impulse could he have
had, when it is public and well known that the English meddled with
nothing that concerned his palace after the sack? Above all he was
immune and free from this for a long time after, and no one would deny
that if he delivered it safely to the cabildo when melted, in the same
way he could have delivered it entire.</p>
<p>By the letter written by the above-mentioned prelate, under date of
October 30, 62, to Don Andres Blanco, your Majesty may see that he
treats me as a rebel. The English condemned me as a rebel and
disobedient to both Majesties on the fourth of November. It resulting
from said sentence that I was condemned by both parties, it is proved
conclusively that I was condemned by the reverend archbishop before I
was condemned by the English, and that the archbishop concurred with
them when they sentenced me. And it is a fact, and all Manila knew it
and saw him present at the council of the English on the day on which
they pronounced so unheard-of a sentence.</p>
<p>With these facts cited, and signed by the hand of the reverend
archbishop, one can recognize clearly the faith that is merited by a
letter which it appears that he wrote in regard to his actions and the
protests of which I am told he made before dying. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>If
all those who died were St. Pauls and the reverend archbishop had shown
the actions of such an one and of a royal vassal of your Majesty, it is
certain that his sayings and expressions ought to be of great
appreciation. But since he was so opposed to the rights of your
Majesty, to those of religion, and that which is least to my honor, it
has been absolutely necessary to draw up this informatory process
purely and nakedly made, so that after examining it, your Majesty may
take the most advisable measures.</p>
<p>I confess to being the least and most useless of your vassals, but
in fidelity, zeal, and disinterestedness to your Majesty&rsquo;s
service, I do not yield to the highest. Consequently, so far as it
concerns me, I would have kept quiet about the ugly stigma of traitor,
simply in order not to reveal the omissions of a prelate, recognizing
its nullity because of the defects of jurisdiction in this one and in
the English; and that I cannot be a rebel to your Majesty when
defending your states, nor to the English since I am not nor have any
desire of being an English vassal. Hence said sentence well understood
becomes a new proof of my nobility and loyalty. It is a shame to the
truth of the nation that it has had a vassal of so extraordinary
thought, and that he could take example from the very enemy. For
although it is true that these followed the rules, because of their
utility and convenience in this matter, of the reverend archbishop,
notwithstanding that they gave me the title of general and
commander-in-chief of the troops of your Majesty in the provinces, and
finally recognized me as your Audiencia, governor, and captain-general.
However, the reverend archbishop, although your <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>vassal, and so honored, passed to the other
life, without doing it. It is a fact that the English declared me a
rebel and traitor; confiscated and sold my property as such; declared
your troops in public edicts to be canaille and robbers; and your
artillery captured in the foundry of Bulacan for more contempt, was
placed under the gallows of this city. Barbarous and unheard of are
these acts of disrespect against the supreme honor of your Majesty, to
whom it alone belongs to ask for the fitting satisfaction, and to me to
report it. But surely the English would not have incurred them, had the
reverend archbishop borne himself as he ought to have done as a
prisoner and had he not treated me as an insurgent. But since the
reverend archbishop and his partisans and many traitors of both estates
whom your Majesty has had, forced the title of rebel and insurgent
against me; and although I was unworthy, I was the only one in whom
your royal name was conserved which since it was becoming utterly
despised in these islands, it appeared absolutely necessary to me,
because of the vassalage which I owe to your Majesty, to defend your
name, although opposed by so many dangers to my life, surrounded by
traitors and assassins, who came from Manila to attack my person, which
without a soldier or the slightest war equipment, during the first six
months it was conserved, I believe, by divine Providence alone for
defending a cause so just as the side of your Majesty.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4352src" href="#xd27e4352" name="xd27e4352src">9</a>
On the day when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284"
name="pb284">284</a>]</span>they captured the fort, the enemy had more
friends in it than your Majesty, but much of it was in imitation of a
prelate who had just been governor, whose persuasions and threats were
alone directed to surrendering everything to the English.</p>

</div>
<p>Even if I had understood the law badly, and I had no right by it to
be the governing Audiencia, it was sufficient to have hoisted your
royal standard, so that every loyal vassal might follow it, and with
greater reason, those of character, distinguished and honored by your
Majesty.</p>
<p>I received a letter from the governor of Zamboanga, Don Ygnacio
Andrade, which an English captain left him for the reverend archbishop,
written in the port of San Jorge, June 7, 1762, and signed by Jorge
Pigot, Governor of Madrast. By its expressions one can see the close
and previous correspondence which the reverend archbishop had with the
English. It must be noted that the said captain, Darrimple
[<i>i.e.</i>, Dalrymple] whom it cites later as having sounded all
these islands, of which repeated advices were given to the reverend
archbishop, came to cast anchor in this bay, in the year 61, without
allowing aboard his vessel the guard which the fort sent to him. And
instead of securing him, he showed him many courtesies. That captain
dined at the palace, examined all the walls, its strength, the beach,
even the powder factory, sounded the entire bay, and information having
been given to the fort of this innovation, by a sentinel, yet he was
allowed to go out freely when he pleased. For those special favors, the
said governor of Madr&aacute;s gives him [<i>i.e.</i>, the archbishop]
many thanks, and although it is not expressed in the letters, the head
of the staff <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>which he sends him. The said governor of
Zamboanga sent it as a gift from the English to the reverend
archbishop, who did not care to have his name mixed up in a matter so
delicate.</p>
<p>Lastly, I add for the more complete conviction of your reverend
archbishop, the fact that he refused to send the seal to this your
royal Audiencia, which existed as long as it cared in the barrio of
Santa Cruz; and that rice growers lived outside the walls of this city,
where trade and commerce with the provinces was both free and
continuous, and whence I got the one hundred thousand pesos of said
effects, and most of the war supplies which were the greatest danger,
but not the royal seal.</p>
<p>May God preserve the Catholic royal person of your Majesty for the
protection of these fields of Christendom. Manila, July 23,

in the government (an office really held by Anda). Villacorta, who had
joined Anda, and who had been left in Bacolor by the latter who had
gone to attend to camp matters, claimed the office as senior auditor.
Anda, hearing of the matter, immediately returned to Bacolor.
Villacorta passed the matter off as mere conversation. But Anda
investigating further, found that Galb&aacute;n and Viana claimed that
Bishop Ust&aacute;riz should be governor, in accordance with royal
orders. Anda sought advice from various ecclesiastics, but they all
refused any direct answer except the Jesuit, Franciscan, and Recollect
provincials, who declared in Anda&rsquo;s favor. The discussion was
finally ended by the arrival of the new governor <i lang="la">ad

<h2 class="main">LETTER FROM VELA TO GONZALEZ</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first xd27e4401">&#10016;</p>
<p class="salute">My brother, Antonio Gonzalez:</p>
<p>The letter which you wrote from Madrid arrived together with that of
this place, but no other has arrived. By the same boat also came [news
of] the peace, whereupon the English again delivered the place to our
governor.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4407src" href="#xd27e4407" name=
"xd27e4407src">1</a> It was almost bare of cannon, as the English had
taken them. For eighteen months were we under the rule of the heretic,
with sufferings greater than can be imagined there. They acted toward
us worse than do the victorious Turks toward those whom they conquer.
<i>However, Manila well deserved it, not indeed, because of its total
lack of all Christian procedure, but singularly because of its cursed
neglect of politics</i>, as if the whole world had to respect and fear
us because of our boasting that we are Spaniards.</p>
<p>Manila is a place, which, by its fortification, by its swampy site,
by its location surrounded by a river larger than the Tajo at Toledo,
and by a low sea, and because the only time at which it can be attacked
is at the time of the fierce winds and heavy and almost continuous
rains&mdash;it is, I say&mdash;for all these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>reasons, almost invincible, with less than a
medium defense of true militia. For no power can place here fifteen or
twenty thousand well drilled men. All that would be necessary, in order
to oppose a moderate defense by one thousand or one thousand five
hundred well-drilled men, established in Manila, and aided by the
inhabitants and volunteer Indians. But on the present occasion, when
the sole sinews of the English were about one thousand five hundred
Europeans, and the rest [of their men] about five thousand, whom they
said were ragamuffins from Asia, with the carriages and horses of
Manila driven along its beach, the English could not have effected a
landing. <i>But our archiepiscopal government, counseled by worthless
hearts and by traitors</i>, allowed the English to disembark without
opposition. The fifteen ships cannonaded to no purpose; and because a
cannon caused the greatest ship to retire, order was given not to fire
from the fort without orders, and that it was to be used for the attack
by land. Some commanded, others countermanded, because they asserted
that they would anger the English more. A re&euml;nforcement of drilled
Indians came, but they were not allowed to make a sally, for the
archbishop-governor said that it was better to seize the enemy without
grievously vexing him. In a sally, the Indians reached quite to the
artillery abandoned by the English. The enemy rallied, and the Indians
not having any disciplined re&euml;nforcement, fell back. Four days of
heavy rains, and boisterous winds, which God sent, and by which one
ship was driven ashore, and the others endeavored only to look out for
themselves, gained nothing for the obstruction of the English, neither
toward the sea, nor toward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href=
"#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>[land]. Their powder was used up,
<i>and they dead with hunger and with cold, could not resist</i>. <i>It
was thus that the traitors arranged it with the worthy archbishop, who
would listen to no one but to those who had the boldness to introduce
English officers who had been invited to dine, into Manila. There it
was agreed that the assault was to be made October 5, and that all
would be defenseless and open. So it happened.</i> At seven or eight
o&rsquo;clock, it was ordered that the garrison of the attacked bastion
and of its lateral, should retire to breakfast. Some loyal men refused,
as they were fearful of the outcome. Thereupon, the English attacked
the bastion, which did not even have any breach, but some holes which
[occur] in the soft stone of this region. And climbing from hole to
hole, and those from below aiding those who were climbing, they mounted
the bastion. The lateral, although it did not have more than three men,
fired a cannon contrary to orders, and others also captured the highest
officer of the attack. It was enough to make all the rest of the
English retire; but encouraged by seeing their men in the attacked
bastion, and that the lateral was now firing no more, for the three
alone could not manage their cannons, the crowd mounted the bastion,
<i>and then a traitor guided them</i>. There was no reserve in the fort
for such a blow. They reached the square of the palace, where only the
Indians resisted them. But they yielded to the instances of some
Spaniards who saw that resistance was already dangerous. The
archbishop-governor left the citadel where he could have defended
himself very easily: and he could even have easily recovered the fort
and chapter house; but neither one nor the others did that.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>The citadel was to be surrendered, as well as
Cavite, but our ship which was coming was to be left alone, if they had
not already captured it before the fifth of October. <i>A few days
after, all the islands were likewise to be delivered up, and four
millions [of pesos].</i></p>
<p>Auditor Anda departed one day before with authority from the
governor and Audiencia, to maintain royal jurisdiction in the islands.
He did so as by a miracle, having retired to Pampanga. The English
wished to first conquer Pasig, which was guarded by Indians. They
attained their end after a short bombardment, and opened a passage to
the provisions of Laguna. They thought it best also to go to Pampanga
to destroy Se&ntilde;or Anda, but having been attacked about one legua
or so from Manila by Se&ntilde;or Anda&rsquo;s men, they were
completely routed, and left many slain. The survivors fled to Manila as
best they could, notwithstanding that a third part of our men, deceived
by the traitors of Manila, did not attack, contrary to the order of
Se&ntilde;or Anda. The English and their allies, our traitors, seeing
that it was difficult by force, devoted their energies to trickery.
First, they tried to induce the Chinese to kill Se&ntilde;or Anda, as
he was now cried by heralds as a traitor to the king and a reward of
two or four thousand pesos promised to whomever should kill and deliver
him up. The Chinese had agreed upon the fitting night to kill him and
all the Spaniards of his faction. A few days before, having some
suspicion, he seized a letter from a Chinese written in Chinese
characters to another Chinese of Manila. He summoned a Chinese mestizo
to interpret it. But either for malice or through ignorance, the latter
said whatever <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>came into his head. Thereupon, he made use of a
Dominican Chinese, who declared the treason of the letter. Days before
the arrival of this declaration, everything was already known, because
a Chinese fired a blunderbuss at Se&ntilde;or Anda which only damaged
his coat. Thereupon, he seized as many Chinese as he could with his
small troop of Spaniards and Indians, and after taking their
depositions had them hanged. There were more than two hundred [of
them]. Many others who escaped informed the English and Chinese of
Manila, and the latter petitioned the English to kill all the Spaniards
of Manila, while they would do the same with those outside, without
excepting the ecclesiastics. The English would not consent, but
determined to attack Pampanga, encouraged more by the treason of the
Indians of Laguna who treacherously killed their alcalde and other
Spaniards, and set another ambush for those who escaped on the
following day, though the latter also escaped that. The cause for this
attempt was that the alcalde punished the captain of a village because
he had invited all the province to welcome the English with a hundred
maidens so that they might have their aid in killing all the Spaniards.
The hardships that the Spaniards, who fled from the English, suffered
in all the villages of Laguna, are unspeakable.</p>
<p>With these results the English were emboldened to besiege Bulacan,
in order to open a road to Pampanga. Aided by the Sangleys, and much
more by the Spanish traitors of Manila, who gave them the method of
being able to attain it, and secretly perverted many chiefs of the
village, the English set out on the roads shown them by the traitors.
Although <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>it cost them many people, they seized the
church, for the Spaniards ran short of powder, as the Indians, induced
by the Spaniards of Manila, had hidden it. But the loyal Spaniards of
Bulacan, by means of stratagem and trickery, held the English besieged
in the same church. Three times did the latter receive
re&euml;nforcements of supplies and men from Manila, but they were
never able to pass. Finally, those who were left returned to Manila
with great loss. And not even one would have returned had it not been
that continually, because of the treachery of the Indians, they found
the few Spaniards without powder.</p>
<p>The English tried, finally, to drive out the rest, so that they
could seize the silver of our ship, and attacked our advance troop with
great secrecy. They reached the troop at dawn. The fire was heavy, and
caused the English to retire completely routed; and had we not lacked
carriages to our cannons, not a single Englishman would have returned
to Manila, where they arrived scattered, and with many of the chief
officers wounded. Our killed did not reach the number of ten, while
theirs, counting the Chinese, exceeded one thousand. Next night they
endeavored to prevent our troops from taking the bells of Quiapo for
cannons, and without succeeding against only fifteen Spaniards, they
lost more than fifty English and more than two hundred Chinese. They
attempted to enter Pampanga by sea with one ship and small boats, but
they left many dead on the beach and some of their boats, while the
ship and those who could get back to it fled to Cavite. In fine, we
have found them cowardly; and had they not been aided by traitors and
Chinese they would not have captured Manila, nor after capturing it
could they have retained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href=
"#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>it two months. The losses which
have been incurred because of them exceed four millions. Father Joaquin
Mezquida and Father Patricio del Barrio are going [to Spain] as
procurators, and they can tell much, although not all.</p>
<p>Father Mezquida is taking one hundred pesos so that my brother, your
uncle, Manuel, may divide them equally among your mother, my sister
Ana, my brother Lucas, and my sister Juana; the children also of my
brother Joseph sharing equally&mdash;not each one a part, but one part
among them all. I do not know whether this will reach the ship, and I
am making the greatest efforts in writing, for I am secretary to the
provincial Pazuengos whom you knew there.</p>
<p>My brother will tell my brother Manuel that I wrote him quite at
length by the ship captured by the English, thanking him for the aid
which he extended to Ana&rsquo;s two children; and that in regard to
the other matter between him and his wife, it is better for him to do
it alone, and it will be better for his nephews, and that he should
forget the wrongs that come to his mind. Tell him also to send me by
Father Patricio two pairs of gray worsted stockings because my legs get
cold, some pairs of scissors of good temper, and some boxwood combs. I
tell you this in case I can not write it to him. And since my [brother]
lives in Madrid, let him get from the fathers the Mercurios<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4456src" href="#xd27e4456" name="xd27e4456src">2</a>
and interesting papers that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href=
"#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>are published and send them to me.
Little by little, my brother can get many of them, for after some
months, people do not care for them, and do not object to giving
them.</p>
<p>Tell your mother, when you see her, to pray God for me often, and
that I hope that my desires of seeing her in heaven soon will be
answered, for now my health is not what it was before. Manila, July 24,
1764. My brother&rsquo;s humble servant,</p>

<h2 class="main">SYNOPSIS OF COMMUNICATIONS BY ANDA TO CARLOS III</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Substantial extract of the result and purpose of
forty-six representations made to his Majesty by Don Simon de Anda
Salazar, informing him of what he has done as Audiencia, governor, and
captain-general of Filipinas during all the time that the English
occupied the city of Manila and its port of Cavite, under terms of the
capitulation which was made between the English general and the
reverend archbishop who was governing those islands at that
time.</i></p>
<p>All the representations are dated June and July, of last year 1764.
Among them some relate that the archbishop-governor and the other
auditors of that Audiencia having been made prisoners of war in Manila,
Don Simon not having been included among them because of being in the
village of Bulacan at that time, attending to the general inspection of
all the provinces of the district of that Audiencia, in accordance with
the order and prescription of law clxxx of t&iacute;tulo xv, book ii of
the laws of the Yndias, by which it is ordered that if the auditors of
the Audiencia are absent and only one of them remain, the Audiencia is
to be conserved and continued in him as said governor and
captain-general, in accordance with other determining laws.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span></p>
<p>Under this character, he proceeded immediately to enact measures
according as his spirit dictated to him, both for the military, and in
order to restrict the English to the vicinity of Manila, causing
himself to be obeyed, assembling troops, furnishing arms, getting
ammunition, and doing in this line whatever he could, the most
experienced and practical general making sallies, holding functions,
remaining glorious in his expeditions, and the enemy conquered and
intimidated.</p>
<p>In regard to what concerns the representation of the Audiencia, he
exercised all the jurisdiction which belonged to it, administering
justice to the parties at law, punishing criminals, and fulminating
causes against those under suspicion of disloyalty.</p>
<p>As governor he attended to all economic matters. In order that
provisions might not fail, or be sold at a dearer price than they had
before the siege of Manila in those provinces, for that purpose he made
regulations, published edicts, imposing severe penalties on those who
transgressed them. By this method he obtained the end which he desired.
He also succeeded in getting the royal official treasurer who had
removed the treasury from Manila as soon as the squadron of the enemy
entered that bay, to transfer it from the province of Laguna to that of
Bulacan, where the above-mentioned Don Simon was stationed in order
that he might have some means to meet the needs that might arise. He
forbade anyone to dare to go to the city of Manila, or under any
pretext, to carry food, or arms [thither]. Neither was permission given
to give entrance, lodging, aid, or help to the English. Those vassals
obeyed that as well as the calced religious of St. Augustine, who had
the province of Bulacan in charge. The Augustinians <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>attended the several meetings which he called,
all of them showing love and zeal for the service of their king and
sovereign, and a blind obedience to Don Simon de Anda, whom they
recognized as Audiencia, governor, and captain-general. They succeeded
in preventing the blotting out of the name of his Majesty from those
provinces, and observed a steadfast obedience to him.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4507src" href="#xd27e4507" name="xd27e4507src">1</a></p>
<p>There result also the various measures which he enacted in order to
assure the patache &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; and its wealth, which came
from Acapulco and had arrived at the province of Leite, and which was
thought to be exposed to surprise and capture by the enemy. Those
attempts succeeded so happily that they were landed and taken overland
to the province of Pampanga.</p>
<p>The treasure carried by said patache belonging to his Majesty, the
ecclesiastical estate, and the trade of those islands, reached the sum
of two million two hundred and fifty-three thousand one hundred and
eleven pesos. To that sum was added fifty-six thousand pesos which were
collected from various private persons, in obedience to the order
despatched for that purpose. And with previous proof that they, the
interested persons, were faithful vassals, and by virtue of the reports
of two arbitrators of the commerce, he delivered them some sums so that
they could support themselves. He also caused the wine <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>casks, chests, and other articles of volume,
which the said patache carried to be kept until he placed all in safety
with the exception of the cargo of a champan which was lost in the
province of Batangas. Among those effects was the stamped [<i>i.e.</i>,
official] paper. As soon as Manila was surrendered and the English
dislodged, Don Simon placed in the hands of his successor, Don
Francisco de la Torre, the testimony of the acts which he had drawn up
in this particular for its convoy, and asserts that from the saving of
the wealth of said patache has resulted the conservation of the
islands, and that the English did not leave them completely desolate,
since without this aid, the subsistence of the state would have been
impossible.</p>
<p>He also gives information that the English declared him a rebel and
offered a reward for his head, having made two embassies to him through
Father Bernardo Pazuengos, provincial of the Society of Jesus, and Fray
Pedro Luis de Sierra, of the Order of Preachers. The first one having
gone without any credentials or authorization, but only as referring to
the British governor, and having refused to make a deposition before a
notary who might attest it, saying that he was to treat alone and in
secret with Don Simon in regard to the matter for which he went,
therefore audience was refused him, and he was despatched with a
warning.</p>
<p>At the second embassy, inasmuch as letters were taken from the
archbishop and from the auditor Don Francisco Enrriquez de Villacorta
and from the above-mentioned father provincial in which they intimated
to him that they would admit means of peace, in order to free the said
auditor from the sentence of death, passed upon him by the council of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>war of the British nation, because some letters
which he had written had been intercepted, he would not consent to it,
and despatched the religious and ordered edicts to be published in
opposition to theirs, offering ten thousand pesos to whomever would
deliver alive or dead each one who had signed the edict [against him].
Finally, there was a suspension of hostilities until the evacuation of
the fort. During this interim, the province of Ylocos revolted and
rendered homage to the king of Gran Breta&ntilde;a. At its head was
Diego Silan, a Pangasinan Indian, a plebeian, who, according to public
report, had been a coachman in Manila. He succeeded in getting the
English to appoint him alcalde-mayor for life of that jurisdiction, and
he accomplished many atrocities and acts of sacrilege. They seized the
alcalde-mayor and his family; took possession of the arms and effects
belonging to his Majesty; and the recognition of paying him tribute and
of assisting with the polos and personal services; obliged the reverend
bishop, Don Fray Bernardo Ustariz, to retire and take to flight,
because he tried to reduce them to reason; committed many thefts and
extortions in the estates; and burned many houses, proceeding with
inhuman cruelty. An expedition was made against them, in which they
were almost defeated, but since the loyal people of Ylocos were
cowardly, and as they were not accustomed to fight, the tyrant was
allowed to reform his forces and to continue with greater violence to
further his prowess and to increase his troops.</p>
<p>Having been informed of such fatal occurrences, and treating for the
common relief, he gave commission to said bishop and to the
vicar-provincial of that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href=
"#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>province to pacify it. He
communicated to them all his own powers, and wrote various letters to
the villages which remained loyal, exhorting them to continue so. But
not having been able to obtain any results by this method, he drew up a
cause, and gave it in review to the fiscal. The latter petitioned that
the most severe punishments be meted out to Diego Silang and the
insurgents. As a result he ordered that a peremptory order of
imprisonment and an edict of citation be issued, entrusting the measure
of its publication to Fray Francisco Antonio Maldonado, an Augustinian
religious, and promising a reward to whomever would communicate it to
Diego Silang, and a greater one if he should obtain his reply. Don
Diego Aldais, a Spanish mestizo, moved by his good zeal, determined to
do this. He passing through the village of Santa Lucia, was seized by
the partisans of the traitor and his letters intercepted. They deprived
the religious ministers of the right to communicate [with one another]
and imprisoned their diocesan prelate. By various letters which he
received, he discovered the alliance which the Ilocans had made with
the Pangasinans,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4529src" href="#xd27e4529"
name="xd27e4529src">2</a> Sangleys, and the English enemy, to whom the
province had been delivered, the go-between in so execrable an outrage
being Don Santiago Orendain, as was proved also by a rough draft of
another letter which he made and sent to Diego Silang, which was
intercepted in his state by Don Manuel Alvarez and presented to him
[<i>i.e.</i>, to Anda].</p>
<p>Informed that the Ilocan Indians were committing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>disorders in this state, some following
steadfastly the party of his Majesty, and others that of Diego
Silang,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4540src" href="#xd27e4540" name=
"xd27e4540src">3</a> he determined with the advice of experienced
persons, to appoint a chief justice and a master-of-camp as
generalisimo, a sargento-mayor of the Catholic villages, and another
master-of-camp and a sargento-mayor in the name of the Monteses
infidels. He despatched them their titles in the name of his Majesty,
granting them the fitting powers for the pacification. That provision
resulted in happy successes, the most happy being that Don Miguel Vicos
killed Diego Silang, at the very time that said tyrant had resolved to
kill the reverend bishop and other religious ministers whom he had
seized. Therefore, that province began to settle down until it became
quiet and restored to the obedience of his Majesty, said prelate having
promised (and Don Simon confirmed it in his Majesty&rsquo;s name) a
general pardon to the natives of that province and exemption from
tribute during the whole time of the war on the necessary condition
that they furnish their ministers of the doctrine with the necessary
stipends for their support. He declared as faithful and noble the
villages of Santa Catalina, Vigan, Bantay, and San Vicente, as they
were the ones which chiefly took part in the enterprise, and opposed
the mutiny; and he gave them the arms which were taken from the leader
of the sedition.</p>
<p>He also gives information of another insurrection which was stirred
up in the province of Pangasinan, and which originated in the village
of Binalatongan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303"
name="pb303">303</a>]</span>which was under the spiritual charge of the
religious of St. Dominic. Those natives, also instigated by the
English, taking as their leader Juan de la Cruz Palaris, an unworthy
man, who had also been a coachman in Manila in the employ of Auditor
Don Francisco Enrriquez de Villacorta, revolted, under the pretext of
various unjust, extravagant, and malicious demands: such as that the
sum of money which they had paid on the account of their tributes was
to be restored, since they could not have any trade with Manila, as the
English were in power there, and if the latter were to make them pay
tribute, they would be paying a double tribute; that four men, whom
they gave as a guard of the prisoners of the prison were to be relieved
from the polos; that the dignity of cacique was to be taken from two
heads of barangay; that the boys schoolmaster was to be changed as he
was a flatterer; that the badge of general master-of-camp of that
province was not to be given outside the village of Binalatongan; that
the alcalde, the father ministers, and their convents were to be
removed if they did not aid them in the attainment of their attempt,
and they would build new churches and would establish new fathers.
Finally they petitioned that no one who did not originate from his
village should hold the staff of office in the tribunal.</p>
<p>This insurrection, after various incidents in which it was necessary
to give the fitting authorizations to various religious, and appoint
Don Juan Antonio Panelo, a person of great merit and conduct as his
lieutenant, in order that they might pacify and reduce that province,
and that some Spaniards might accompany the latter, giving them the
necessary instructions; yet they could do nothing, since, fearful
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>of the death which the insurgents wished to
inflict on them, they fled the province. Consequently, he gave
commission to other religious; prepared soldiers so that they might go
to reduce the province, under command of Don Fernando Arayat. The
latter&rsquo;s troop departed on the expedition, and the Pampangos
advancing on their march, took position in front of the enemy. Having
sent an embassy to them, so that they might submit, they answered that
they did not wish it, since, if his Majesty had muskets, they had
cannons and muskets. Notwithstanding that they had them, the
commandant, having summoned them in writing, and inviting them to make
peace, and seeing the contempt that they showed of his proposition, was
compelled to make war upon them, attacking them in the trenches which
they had made with thirty-four muskets and five hundred natives,
counting Pampangos and Cagayans, after summoning them to peace five
times. They replied to his summons from the trench that they had flung
their banner to the breeze, with a shot from a cannon of the caliber of
four, and two shots from falconets. Thereupon, Don Pedro Hernani,
lieutenant of Spanish infantry, with one sergeant, one corporal, and
twenty soldiers, began to cross the river in pursuit of the Cagayans,
leaving Alf&eacute;rez Don Jose Solorzano as a reserve. Don Pedro
Hernani invested the trenches with so great courage, that he succeeded
in taking the banner from them, although he suffered the misfortune of
being run through the breast with a lance and fell dead. But Don Pedro
Fagle substituted him, and picked up the flag, which he delivered to
his commandant. The latter afterward presented it to Don Simon de Anda.
It was two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>varas long and a trifle more narrow. At each
corner it had a two-headed eagle, and in the center an escutcheon with
its border, and within it the arms of the Order of St. Dominic. They
also wounded a Spanish soldier with a poisoned arrow from which he died
raving. Since the number of the enemy was vast, their position
advantageous, and the river which they had in front, not being able [to
be crossed] as it had swollen, obliged them to retire. But desiring to
avoid all confusion of blood, and manifesting to them the love of his
Majesty for his vassals, he [<i>i.e.</i>, the Spanish commander]
forbore to attack them again, reiterating that he would act mildly,
entrusting the matter to another Dominican religious and the practical
business to the master-of-camp Manalartay.</p>
<p>Finally, the bishop of Nueva Segovia, Don Fray Bernardo Ustariz,
having taken upon himself the obligation of pacifying them, set about
various measures and succeeded in reducing them. A few days afterward
they sent a deputation to Don Simon, asking mercy, bearing
recommendations from the abovesaid bishop, and manifesting their
repentance. They recognized his Majesty as their only sovereign and
asked for an alcalde-mayor to govern them. He condescended to this,
pardoning them with warning that he would proceed against them in case
they repeated their error. Juan Palaris and Domingo Magalog, his
brother, were included in the pardon. He ordered Don Joaquin Gamboa to
be restored to his office as alcalde-mayor, but the latter resigned.
Consequently, the office of alcalde-mayor was given to Don Jose
Acevedo. Various measures were taken so that the families who had
retired to Pampanga <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306"
name="pb306">306</a>]</span>and fled the insurrection, might be
restored to Pangasinan.</p>
<p>He also recommends the religious orders for the good services which
they have rendered, especially that of the calced Augustinians, who
have suffered total ruin, as have those who have most shown their love
and fidelity during the invasion of the English.</p>
<p>He also manifests the distrust which he recognized in some religious
of St. John of God, as they had opposed a government measure conducive
to the royal service. But since this was a prohibition to taking from
an estate, which they had, food for their hospital of Manila, it is to
be noted that this is a complaint or accusation more befitting an
indiscreet zeal, namely, of the charity with which the religious must
have worked, in order that their sick might not perish, without one
being able for this reason to attribute it to disloyalty.</p>
<p>Lastly, he gives account of the measures which he took in order to
continue the aid which had been established on his Majesty&rsquo;s
account in honor of Fernando I, king of Jol&oacute;. He states that, at
the beginning of the expedition, the king showed himself loyal to his
Majesty, and recognized Don Simon as Audiencia, and governor, asking
him to assign him to those provinces or to send him to his country,
whence he would send him the aid, which he asked of him. Having advised
him that he would transfer him to Pampanga, he promptly arranged his
voyage, and having arrived at the village of Pasig, he was overtaken by
an accident which impeded him for six days. During that interim, the
enemy made him a prisoner. The English, taking advantage of the
occasion, sent him to Jol&oacute;. Afterward when the English
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>evacuated Manila, they took the prince Ysrael
and all those of his kingdom. It was presumed that the English had made
some agreement with him, so that they might establish themselves in
Jol&oacute;. That would be to the great prejudice of the Visayan
provinces and their trade both because of the English and the
Moros.</p>
<p>In a separate measure, both Don Simon de Anda, in his
representations, and the royal lieutenant, Don Francisco de la Torre,
governor <i lang="la">ad interim</i> of Filipinas, discuss the receipt
of a royal decree, despatched July 18, 1762, by which a fine of two
thousand pesos was declared against the auditor Don Francisco de
Villacorta, and the fiscal, Don Francisco Leandro de Viana, because of
the irregularity of the process which they prosecuted against Doctor
Don Santiago Orendain, which they have not made manifest because of
having produced various exceptions which appear from the records which
he remits. In regard to this affair, he has not wished to make any
innovation until his Majesty decide as to the matter what he considers
just. He encloses a report of the royal officials in favor of the
conduct of the above-mentioned fiscal Viana.</p>
<p>He also reports with records, the summary investigation of the crime
of disloyalty, which was incurred by Doctor Don Santiago Orendain as
being partial to and director of the British government. Don Simon
delivered that matter to his successor, so that he might continue it.
This man and his family went with the English when they evacuated the
fort of Manila, to the city of Madras.</p>
<p>The royal lieutenant also discusses, when advising of the receipt of
a royal decree, dated July 23, 762, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>the question of not
forbidding Sangley converts from going to the house of the catechumens,
and gives information of the league which the Christian Sangleys made
with the English, and the atrocities which they committed. He publicly
ordered their rites, and concluded with petitioning the total expulsion
of the Sangleys who have kept the title of Christian, as was done with
the infidels; in which Don Simon and the ecclesiastical estate also
co&ouml;perate with convincing and practical reasons.</p>
<p>From all the above, it results from this extract that measures could
have been taken in regard to only the two matters: one in regard to the
absolute expulsion of the Christian Sangleys from those islands; and
the other ordering that a rule be given as to what ought to be done in
the future in a like case, when one single minister remains as governor
as happened to Don Simon, and restitution [of the government] having
been made, if the governor has acted with ignominy, whether the staff
of office is or is not to be given to him by the minister who has held
the command. These two measures look toward the future; for what was
done by Don Simon is approved by his Majesty and whatever said Don
Simon has done ought to be approved&mdash;the posts which he has given,
the expenses which he has incurred, and which he has made on the
account of the royal treasury. In a word he has become worthy, not only
of the reward which he has now obtained from the royal magnificence,
but also of eternal memory. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href=

<p>The Conquest of Manila, Cavita, and the whole Phillipine Islands,
having been of late the Topic of Conversation, from the Crown of
Spain&rsquo;s Refusal to pay the Bills drawn by its Archbishop and
Captain-General, in Consequence of the Capitulation;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4607src" href="#xd27e4607" name="xd27e4607src">2</a> and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>having Reason to apprehend, that the Public are
as ignorant of the Nature and Importance of that Acquisition, as they
seem to be unacquainted with the Particulars relative to the
Capitulation, and its Consequences; I think it a Duty incumbent on me
to set the material Transactions of that Expedition in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>proper Point of View, as well as in Justice to
my own Conduct and Character, as to the Officers and Men serving under
me: and for the particular Information of the Representatives of the
Nation, who have condescended to think our Services deserving their
public Approbation of our Conduct, in the particular Honour of their
Thanks conveyed to us by their Speaker.</p>
<p>Manila is the Metropolis of the Phillipine Islands, situated in a
large Bay on the Island of Luconia, in the Latitude 14, 40 North,
Longitude 118 East, from London, in Possession of the Spaniards, and
maintained by the Crown of Spain, at the Request of the Church for
propagating the Christian Faith among the Indians, for which they have
a large annual Allowance from Mexico, for the Maintenance of their
public Officers and Clergy, and for the support of their Convents: They
are also indulged with Ships, built and navigated at the King&rsquo;s
Expence, to bring the said Allowance in Money: These Ships go laden
with Merchandize belonging to the Inhabitants (a still further
Indulgence allowed them) from Manila to Acapulca, and return with
Money: The King&rsquo;s is registered; and the Remainder (about as much
more) a smuggling Trade, and connived at.</p>
<p>This trade is so very prejudicial to Old Spain, the Cargoes they
send being China Silks, India Cottons, Spices, &amp;c., for the Use of
the People in America, that the Cadiz and Bayone Companies have
frequently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>presented the strongest Memorials and
Remonstrances to the King, setting forth the Damage sustained by it,
but without any Success, the Church always getting the better of
them.</p>
<p>In Consequence of Orders from Europe to attack Manila on the War
with Spain, the Squadron and Troops sailed from Madrass the First of
August, 1762, and arrived in the Bay of Manila the 24th of September
following; and after summoning the Town to surrender, and receiving for
Answer their Resolution to defend it, the Troops were immediately
landed, and began the Siege. A breach being made the 6th of October, we
stormed and took the City, on which the principal Inhabitants retired
into the Citadel, but sensible they could not hold it long, sent out a
Flag of Truce, desiring to capitulate. The Terms offered were, on
paying &ldquo;Four Millions of Dollars, they were to have their
Churches, Convents, Palaces, and other public Buildings, with the Town
preserved, the Plundering stopped, with the free exercise of their
Religion, and other Liberties; otherwise to be Prisoners of War, and
put on Board the Squadron, and sent to the Coast of India as
such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These Terms they accepted; and whilst the Articles were settling,
they pleaded their Inability to raise immediately the Sum demanded,
unless we would admit the Phillipina (which was arrived &iexcl;n the
Port of Pallapa, on the Island of Semar from Acapulca) into the
Capitulation, and the Vice Roy to send Letters to the General that
commanded her, to deliver her up to our Ships, which had been sent
after her; to which we assented, on Condition that the said Phillipina
was actually in the Port of Pallapa, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>and delivered up to
our Ships in Consequence of the said Letter. <i>This is the only Ship
ever admitted into the Capitulation (and that Conditionally) and which,
instead of being delivered up, or ordered to proceed to Manila,
agreeable to the promised Letter of the Vice Roy, was, by other
Letters, privately sent unknown to us, directed not to comply with the
Vice Roy&rsquo;s Letter, but to land the Money on the Island where they
were, and secure it in the best Manner they could until they should
receive further Directions from Manila.</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4695src" href="#xd27e4695" name="xd27e4695src">3</a></p>
<p>All things being thus agreed upon, the plundering the Town was
immediately Stopped<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4700src" href=
"#xd27e4700" name="xd27e4700src">4</a> and the City restored to Order,
an Account taken of the Ordnance and military Stores, and the Garrison
established, which took up the whole of the Troops of the Expedition;
and the Place (in Obedience to his Majesty&rsquo;s Instructions)
delivered up to the East India Company&rsquo;s Agent for their Use and
Benefit, until his further Pleasure should be known. During these
Transactions the Treasure remaining in the Town (a great deal being
conveyed out during the Siege) was collected together, and the
principal Inhabitants voluntarily taxed themselves to pay the Remainder
as far as two Millions; and if the Phillipina was not to be got at, we
were to take Bills on the King of Spain for the other two Millions,
which the Captain General, or Viceroy, (who was also Archbishop)
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>declared he had Authority to draw, and would be
duly honoured.</p>
<p>As soon as the Place was in Possession of the East India Company,
the Spaniards perceived the King&rsquo;s Officers had no further Power
over them, and therefore stopped any further Collections toward the
Payment; and from the Excess of Lenity hitherto shown them, soon grew
insolent, broke every Part of the Capitulation by retiring into the
Country and joining Anda, one of the Royal Audience, who had taken up
Arms, and proclaimed himself Captain General, while their Priests and
Friars publicly exhorted Rebellion, and preached it meritorious to take
up Arms and destroy us.</p>
<p>As several of the principal Men of the Place were likewise concerned
with him, the Captors were justly apprehensive that little or nothing
more was to be got by fair Means, and were willing to secure what was
still in their Power; and therefore ordered their Agents to bring into
the City what Merchandize was belonging to the said Men in the Suburbs,
as a Security till they made good their Ransom. But were greatly
surprized to find the East India Company&rsquo;s Governor had placed
Guards, and would not suffer the Agents to remove any one Thing, by
which the Captors lost upwards of 200,000 Dollars. The Captors
therefore to secure what little yet remained in their Power, gave
Directions to seize, and dispose of a Ship, named the Santo
Nino,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4709src" href="#xd27e4709" name=
"xd27e4709src">5</a> that lay in the Port <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>of Cavita at the Time
of the Town being taken, and placed her Produce to the Account of the
four Million (altho&rsquo; she was not mentioned or included in the
Capitulation). <i>This was the only Ship taken in the Port, and sold
for only 16,000 Dollars, and which the Spaniards have since artfully
and jesuitically endeavored to propagate to be the Santissima Trinidad;
tis therefore in this Place necessary to make known, that the
Santissima Trinidad sailed from Manila on the 1st of August, which was
upwards of seven Weeks before the Squadron arrived there, and had
proceeded several hundred Leagues on her Voyage to Acapulca; when
meeting with a Storm she was dismasted, and endeavouring to put back to
refit was met with off the Island of Capul by two of our Ships, the
Panther and Argo (the two Ships that were detached after the
Phillipina) and after an Engagement taken by them, above two hundred
Miles from the Port of Manila, and which Ships knew nothing at that
Time of the Surrender or Capitulation of Manila.</i> These two Ships
that were sent after the Phillipina (in Consequence of Intelligence
obtained by a Gally we took in the Bay soon after our Arrival) had got
as far as the Island of Capul, in their Way to Palapa, when they met
with the Trinidad, and she being much disabled, and having a great
Number of Men on Board, they were obliged to return to the Bay of
Manila with her; on which, as soon as possible, two Frigates were
dispatched again after the Phillipina, but before they could reach the
Streights of St. Bernardino, the North-East Monsoon was set in, and the
Weather too stormy to pass the Streights, and after ten Weeks
fruitlessly attempting it, were obliged to return. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Squadron being obliged (by Instructions on that Head) to return
to the Coast of India for the Protection of the East India
Company&rsquo;s Settlements, before the North-East Monsoon was expired,
sailed from the Bay of Manila the beginning of March, leaving orders
with the Commanding Officer of the Ships left for the Protection of the
Place, so soon as the South-West Monsoon prevailed, to proceed to
Palapa, in order to take Possession of the Phillipina, who, on his
Arrival, found only the Ship, the Treasure having been carried in small
Vessels to the Island of Luconia by Orders from the Inhabitants of
Manila, who had all this Time amused us with the Promise of the Money
of this Ship for Payment, and even sent Men as Hostages<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4720src" href="#xd27e4720" name="xd27e4720src">6</a>
in our Ships to get it, notwithstanding they themselves well knew it
was removed from that Place. Through the whole of the above
Transactions, the Spaniards by Evasions avoided complying with the
Capitulation in every one Respect, except in the bringing in the Money
from the Misericordia and Ordentercara, which was out of their Power to
secrete. They basely and ungratefully took up Arms against us, after
having their Lives given them. They preached publicly in their Churches
Rebellion, and meritorious to destroy us.</p>
<p>And these people have still furthermore the Impudence to charge us
with an Infringment of the Capitulation, and the Effrontery to claim
the Santissima Trinidad, which was taken above 200 Miles from Manila by
two of his Majesty&rsquo;s Ships, who knew nothing of the Surrender of

<p>It is true they have given Bills on the King their Master for Part
of the Ransom, which he does not acknowledge they had a Right to draw,
and therefore refuses Payment of. But surely I may with Equity be
permitted to add, that as he allows them a very large Sum annually for
their Support, and has again put the Place into their Possession, is he
not bound in Honour and strict Justice to oblige his Subjects to make
good their solemn Covenant and Capitulation, having the Means so fully

That they must remain for the Defence of the Place; but were afterward
told, That if the Spaniards would give Security for the Payment of the
Value of them, they were to be left; if they would not, the East India

<p class="salute">My Lord,</p>
<p>Armed with that Boldness which Innocence inspires, and the
Consciousness of having done my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319"
href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>Duty, both as an Officer, and
a Man of Honour and Humanity; I presume again to lay before your
Lordship my Answer to the <i>Spanish</i> Ambassador&rsquo;s
Memorial.</p>
<p>This Reply is something more copious than the former, which I had
the Honour of presenting to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href=
"#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>your Lordship in <i>March</i>
last: The new Arguments that have been urged to evade Payment,
requiring fresh Reasons to endeavour to enforce it.</p>
<p>I was in great Hopes, that the good Faith, Honour, and Punctuality
of the <i>Spanish</i> Nation, would have made this Publication
unnecessary. But finding, that they have absolutely refused Payment of
the Ransom Bills, drawn upon their Treasury by the Governor of
<i>Manila</i>, and do now claim the Restitution of the Galeon, I am
constrained, for the Sake of those brave Men, to whom I am obliged and
indebted for my Success, to assert their Rights, in the best Manner I
am able.</p>
<p>Many of them, my Lord, from the too usual and sanguine Hopes of
their Profession, have already anticipated their supposed Profits, and
may live to repent their fatal Success in a Jail; unless the powerful
Intercession of the Government will rescue them from impending Misery
or Destruction. They vainly look up to me for that Protection, which in
their Names, I again request from your Lordship&rsquo;s good
Offices.</p>
<p>I must add, that the calumnious and envenomed Attack upon my own
Character, demands the most public Justification: Being described both
at Home and Abroad, as a Man void of all Faith, Principle, or common
Honesty; and so, indeed, I should be most deservedly thought, were I
guilty even of the smallest Part of what the <i>Spanish</i> Memorial
accuses me. A Dey of <i>Tunis</i>, or <i>Algiers</i>, would blush to
make use of so black an Instrument of Perfidy and Piracy. I owe,
therefore, this open Vindication of my Conduct, both to my Sovereign,
and to my Country, whose Representatives were pleased to honour
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>me with their public Thanks, the greatest of all
Rewards, and indeed, the only one I have received for my late
Services.&mdash;<i lang="la">Sed mihi facti fama sat est.</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4977src" href="#xd27e4977" name=

<p>My Silence, perhaps, may be misconstrued; it may be suspected that I
have sacrificed the deluded Partners of my Expedition, to private and
base Considerations; (for something of a dark and private Treaty has
been whispered about) but, I thank Heaven! my Behaviour has been such
as will bear the Light of Day; and the all-searching Eye of Truth.</p>
<p>The <i>Spaniards</i> have assigned my Breach of Faith in the
Capitulation, as one Reason for their Refusal of Payment: I cannot,
therefore, servilely stoop, or submit to the heavy Load of Guilt, with
which they have endeavoured to overwhelm me. But perhaps, a Second
<i>Gondemar</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e4991src" href="#xd27e4991"
name="xd27e4991src">10</a> is arrived amongst us: Yet the Happiness of
the Times, we have the good Fortune to live in, forbids me to carry the
Allusion any farther; nor have I the Vanity to compare myself to the
great <i>Raleigh</i>, even in Miniature; a very unjust and vindictive
Accusation, forms the only Part of the Parallel betwixt us. But as the
execrable Days of <i>James</i> the First can never be renewed under the
Reign of our most just, good, and gracious Sovereign, I will not
harbour the least Suspicion that I shall resemble that illustrious Man
in his Misfortune; or remain unprotected, or be sacrificed for my poor
Endeavours to serve my King and Country; to whose Judgments I most
dutifully and humbly submit my Cause. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>The <i>English</i> Generals who made themselves Masters of
<i>Manila</i> proposed, on the<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5035src"
href="#xd27e5035" name="xd27e5035src">12</a> Fifth of <i>October</i>,
1762, a Capitulation to the Archbishop, who acted as Governor; by which
they promised to preserve the City from Pillage, if the Governor and
principal Magistrates would consent to, and sign the Articles of, the
said Capitulation; which they were forced to do, being threatened to be
put to the Sword, in Case of Refusal.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this shameful Capitulation, extorted and signed by
the Means of Violence and Rigor, General <i>Draper</i> ordered or
suffered the City to be sacked and pillaged, for forty Hours, by Four
Thousand <i>English</i>, who plundered it of more than a Million of
Dollars.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5058src" href="#xd27e5058" name=

"#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p>Therefore the said Capitulation ought to be void, because it was
signed by force; and because General <i>Draper</i> first violated and
broke the Capitulation, by permitting the City to be pillaged.
Consequently, that Capitulation only, which was proposed by the
Governor, accepted of, and signed by Admiral <i>Cornish</i> and General
<i>Draper</i>, upon the seventh of <i>October</i>, ought to be
considered and respected in this Affair.</p>
<p>The First Article of which grants to the Inhabitants of
<i>Manila</i>, the peaceable and quiet Possession of all their Effects;
the Fourth and Sixth grant them the Liberty of Commerce, under the
Protection of his <i>Britannic</i> Majesty.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p><i>Refutation</i></p>
<p>It is a known and universal Rule of War amongst the most civilized
Nations, that Places taken by Storm, without any Capitulation, are
subject to all the Miseries that the Conquerors may chuse to
inflict.</p>
<p><i>Manila</i>, my Lord, was in this horrid Situation; of Consequence
the Lives of the Inhabitants, with all belonging to them, were entirely
at our Mercy. But Christianity, Humanity, the Dignity of our Nation,
and our own Feelings as Men, induced us not to exert <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>the
utmost Rigours of the Profession, against those wretched Suppliants;
although my own Secretary, Lieutenant <i>Fryar</i>, had been murdered,
as he was carrying a Flag of Truce to the Town. The Admiral and I told
the Archbishop and principal Magistrates, that we were desirous to save
so fine a City from Destruction, ordered them to withdraw, consult, and
propose such Terms of Compensation as might satisfy the Fleet and Army,
and exempt them from Pillage, and its fatal Consequences.</p>
<p>The Proposals they gave in, were the very same, which the
<i>Spaniards</i> most artfully call a Second Capitulation; and were
afterwards agreed to, and confirmed by us (with a few Restrictions) but
at that time were so unsuitable to their desperate Situation, that we
rejected them as unsatisfactory and inadmissible. As Conquerors, we
took the Pen, and dictated those Terms of the Ransom which the
<i>Spaniards</i> thought proper to submit to; for they had the
Alternative, either to be passive under the Horrors of a Pillage, or
compound for their Preservation; they accepted the latter.</p>
<p>The Objection and Pretence of Force and Violence may be made use of
to evade any military Agreements whatsoever, where the two Parties do
not treat upon an Equality; for who, in War, will submit to an
inconvenient and prejudicial Compact, unless from Force? But have the
<i>Spaniards</i> forgot their own Histories? Or will they not remember
the just Indignation expressed against <i>Francis</i> the First, who
pleaded the like Subterfuge of Force and Violence, to evade the Treaty
made after the Battle of <i>Pavia</i>, and his Captivity?</p>
<p>Should such elusive Doctrines prevail, it will be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>impossible, hereafter, for the Vanquished to
obtain any Quarter or Terms whatsoever: The War will be carried on
<i lang="la">usque ad internecionem</i>;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5133src" href="#xd27e5133" name="xd27e5133src">14</a> and if a
Sovereign shall refuse to confirm the Conditions stipulated by his
Subjects, who are in such critical Situations, the Consequences are too
horrid to mention.</p>
<p>By the same fallacious Sophistry, a State may object to the Payment
of the Ransoms of Ships taken at Sea, and to Contributions levied in a
Country which is the Seat of War. But it is always allowed, that in
such Cases, a Part must be sacrificed to save the Whole; and surely,
when by the Laws of War, we were entitled to the Whole, it was a great
Degree of Moderation to be contented with a Part.</p>
<p>The Destruction that we could have occasioned, would have trebled
the Loss they suffer by the Payment of the Ransom. The rich Churches
and Convents, the King of <i>Spain</i>&rsquo;s own Palace, with its
superb and costly Furniture, the magnificent Buildings of every Sort,
the Fortifications, Docks, Magazines, Founderies, Cannon, and in short
the Whole might have been entirely ruined, the <i>Spanish</i> Empire in
Asia subverted, and the Fruits of their religious Mission lost for
ever,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5148src" href="#xd27e5148" name=
"xd27e5148src">15</a> together with the Lives of many <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>Thousand Inhabitants, who were spared by our
Humanity. As a suitable and grateful Return for this Lenity, the
<i>Spanish</i> Memorial affirms, that after the Capitulation was
signed, General <i>Draper</i> ordered or permitted, the City to be
sacked and pillaged forty Hours together, by Four Thousand
<i>English</i>, who plundered it of more than a Million of Dollars.</p>
<p>As my own Character, both as an Officer, and a Man of Honour, is so
wickedly attacked by this unjust Accusation, I must beg Leave to state
the whole Affair, in its true Light; and do appeal for its Veracity to
the Testimonies of every Officer and Soldier, who served in the
Expedition, and to all of the Marine Department.</p>
<p>We entered <i>Manila</i> by Storm, on the 6th of <i>October</i>
1762, with an Handful of Troops, whose Total amounted to little more
than Two Thousand; a motley Composition of Seamen, Soldiers, Seapoys,
Cafres, Lascars, Topasees, <i>French</i> and <i>German</i>
Deserters.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5179src" href="#xd27e5179" name=
"xd27e5179src">16</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href=
"#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span></p>
<p>Many of the Houses had been abandoned by the frightened Inhabitants,
and were burst open by the Violence of Shot, or Explosion of Shells.
Some of these were entered and pillaged. But all military Men know, how
difficult it is to restrain the Impetuosity of Troops in the first Fury
of an Assault, especially when composed of such a Variety and Confusion
of People, who differed as much in Sentiments and Language, as in Dress
and Complexion.</p>
<p>Several Hours elapsed, before the principal Magistrates could be
brought to a Conference; during that Interval, the Inhabitants were
undoubtedly great Sufferers. But, my Lord, this Violence was antecedent
to our Settling the Terms of the Capitulation, and by the Laws of War,
the Place, with all it&rsquo;s Contents, became the unquestionable
Property of the Captors, until a sufficient Equivalent was given in
Lieu of it. That several Robberies were committed, after the
Capitulation was signed, is not to be denied; for Avarice, Want, and
Rapacity, are ever insatiable: But that the Place was pillaged for
Forty Hours, and that Pillage authorized and permitted by me, is a most
false and infamous Assertion. The People of <i>Manila</i>, my Lord,
have imposed upon their Court, by a Representation of Facts, which
never existed; and to make such a groundless Charge the Reason for
setting aside, and evading a solemn Capitulation, is a Proceeding
unheard of until now, and as void of Decency, as Common Sense.</p>
<p>The following Extracts from the Publick Orders, given out the very
Day we entered the Town, will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328"
href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span>sufficiently convince your
Lordship, of my constant Attention to the Preservation of those
ungrateful People; who have almost taught me to believe, that Humanity
and Compassion are Crimes.</p>
<p><i>Extracts</i></p>
<p class="dateline"><i>October 6th, Manila.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The utmost Order and Regularity to be observed.</p>

Churches, and Houses.</p>
<p class="dateline"><i>October 7th.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;All the Inhabitants of <i>Manila</i> are to be looked upon
and treated as His <i>Britannick</i> Majesty&rsquo;s Subjects: They
having agreed to pay Four Millions of Dollars, for the Ransom and
Preservation of their City and Effects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Criminals executed for Robbery and Sacrilege, to be
buried at Sunset.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5234src" href=
"#xd27e5234" name="xd27e5234src">17</a></p>
<p>I hope the foregoing Extracts, are sufficient to vindicate my
Character. Moreover, the strictest Search was made on board the
Squadron by the Admiral&rsquo;s Orders, and amongst the Troops, to
recover what had been stolen and secreted; and all the Money, Plate,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>and Jewels, so recovered, were put into the
Treasury, and allowed, and accepted of as Part of the Ransom.</p>
<p>Now let us examine the Foundation of the <i>Spanish</i> Pretensions.
In the first Place, they have misstated the Propositions, and made our
Proposals antecedent to theirs, which is impossible. For how could our
Fourth Proposition take Notice of, and consent to theirs, unless from a
previous Knowledge and Perusal of what they had to offer? And indeed,
the whole force of the <i>Spanish</i> Arguments, depends entirely upon
the Second Capitulation, as they are pleased to term it: But the
Liberty of Commerce, and all the other Privileges which they there
insist upon, were granted conditionally, upon their Compliance with the
Fourth Article of our Propositions. It expressly declares, that the
Proposals contained in the Paper, delivered on the Part of his
Excellency the Governor and his Council, will be listened to, and
confirmed to them, upon their Payment of Four Millions of Dollars; the
Half to be paid immediately, the other Half to be paid in a Time agreed
upon; and Hostages<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5255src" href=
"#xd27e5255" name="xd27e5255src">18</a> and Security given for that
Purpose. It is therefore most evident, that they had not the least
Shadow of Right to any Privileges, until this Article was most
punctually fulfilled.</p>
<p>How it has been fulfilled, has been but too clearly manifested, by
the Court of <i>Spain</i>&rsquo;s Refusal to pay the Two Millions of
Dollars, for which we trusted to the Honour and Punctuality of that
Nation. Until <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>that Sum is paid, it is impossible even to name
the Galeon.</p>
<p><i>Postscript</i></p>
<p>It is now pretended that the <i>Spanish</i> Governor exceeded his
Powers, that he had no Authority to draw Bills, of such a Nature, upon
his Court: But will not unforseen Events, demand unforseen Expedients?
In <i>Europe</i>, where the Distance will allow of it, it is
undoubtedly the Duty of every Governor or Commander, to consult his
Sovereign (if an Opportunity offers) before he presumes to give his
Consent to, or ratify any Agreement that may be prejudicial or
dishonourable to his Crown. But can such Formalities be required or
observed at the Distance of half the Globe? The Persons entrusted with
such remote Commands, must be left to their own Discretion; to the
Fertility or Barrenness of their own Invention and Resources. A State
may undoubtedly punish the Man who is found to have betrayed its
Dignity or Interests; but at all Events, it must abide by his
Decisions, how prejudicial soever.</p>
<p>We find in History, that the <i>Romans</i>, have sometimes delivered
up to the Enemy such of their Generals, who had made a shameful or
disadvantageous Peace, without the Consent or Approbation of the
Senate: But that Practice has been universally condemned upon the
truest Reasons; because the Delivery of an Individual could never be
adequate to the Advantages they might acquire by the breaking of a bad
Treaty; or compensate their Enemies for the Opportunities and
Advantages they might give up, or lose, upon the Faith of such an
Agreement.</p>
<p>I flatter myself that the <i>Spaniards</i> will not copy that great
Nation in its Defects, but imitate its Virtues. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is also asserted, that the Ransom Bills were given and accepted
only to preserve the private Property of the Inhabitants; But I do most
solemnly aver, my Lord, that the Ransom was general, as well as
particular. Can Six Hundred Pieces of Brass and Iron Ordnance? can the
Fortifications of the Citadel and Town of <i>Manila</i>, with those of
the Citadel and Port of <i>Cavite</i>, the publick and royal Magazines,
Store-houses, Docks, <i>&amp;c.</i> be called private Property? They
belonged, most undoubtedly, to his Catholic Majesty, and by the stern
Rules of our Profession, might have been destroyed, had the Admiral and
I been disposed to have carried on the War with that Barbarity, of
which other Nations have more than once set us the Example: But we
considered rather how <i>Englishmen</i> should act, than what our
Enemies might have suffered. But let us, for a Moment, admit that the
Bills were drawn for the sake of preserving private Property only: Even
in that Case the <i>Spaniards</i> are bound in Honour to oblige the
People of <i>Manila</i> to pay the Money; and they are now very able to
discharge the Debt, since they have received all the Treasure of the
<i>Philippina</i> Galeon.</p>
<p>Our Court has shewed them a most bright and laudable Example, by
taking Care that all the Ransom Bills, due even to the Enemy&rsquo;s
Privateers, should be most punctually paid, since the Conclusion of the
Peace. Surely such upright Proceedings on our Side will infuse the same
religious Observance of good Faith in all concerned in this Business.
Otherwise we must say with Grotius, <i lang="la">ab Injustiti&acirc;
excusari nequeunt, qui, cum pacta improbent, tamen retinent, qu&aelig;,
sine pactis non haberent</i>. &ldquo;They cannot avoid the Imputation
of Injustice, who disapprove of Treaties, and yet keep Possession of
what they could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332"
name="pb332">332</a>]</span>not have been possessed of, but by the
Means of those Treaties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have an indisputable Right to <i>Manila</i>, and all its
Dependencies, if the Ransom Bills are not faithfully paid.</p>
<p>I do therefore, my Lord, in the Names of all concerned (the Navy,
Army, and <i>East India</i> Company) implore the Assistance and
Protection of the Government, and its effectual good Offices, to
maintain our most just Rights, and recover the Part of the Ransom as
yet unpaid.</p>

question of the ransom:</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for 1764
(vol. xxxiv, p. 544) says, under date of November 15: &ldquo;A
categorical answer came over from the courts of <i>France</i> and
<i>Spain</i>, relative to the payment of the subsistance money due for
the prisoners of the former, and the ransom of the <i>Manillas</i>,
both which, according to this report, have been absolutely refused by
the said powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The <i>London Chronicle</i> for February
28-March 2, 1765 (vol. xvii, no. 1279) says: &ldquo;We hear the
Spaniards want to deduct 1,230,000 piasters, or pieces of eight, out of
the ransom of the Manillas, for the damages and losses the inhabitants
sustained on the 6th of October 1762, when it was taken by storm by the
English forces.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;<i>London, Jan. 25.</i> By letters from
Madrid we are assured that Lord Rochfort had, in consequence of orders
from England, demanded the final sentiments of the Catholic ministry,
respecting the payment of the Manilla ransom, in order to be
transmitted home for the inspection of the grand council of the nation;
and it was current there, that this long protracted affair would soon
be amicably adjusted.&rdquo; (<i>Scots Magazine</i>, 1766, p. 48.)</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;<i>London, May 20.</i> They write from
Madrid, that some dispatches, just received from Manilla, in the East
Indies, which the court had impatiently expected, would possibly hasten
the final payment of the ransom-bills; and that Lord Rochfort appeared
to be on very good terms with the Catholic ministry.&rdquo; (<i lang=
"la">Ut supra</i>, p. 270.)</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;<i>London, Aug. 29.</i> According to
letters from Madrid, one reason alledged for the non-payment of the
Manilla ransom is the delay of the expected flotas from New Spain,
which has rendered the treasury very bare of money.&rdquo; (<i lang=
"la">Ut supra</i>, p. 441.)</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;<i>Paragraph of a letter from
Madrid</i>. Our politicians are at a loss to know what will be the
result of the demand made by the English ambassador, for the payment of
the Manilla ransom. If the English court are really in earnest, it is
generally thought by those who pretend to be conversant in
court-affairs, that the Spanish court would rather pay it, than venture
another war with G. Britain. All I can say in the matter is, that it
should be immediately insisted on, as, in all probability, this court
will prevent the further progress of trade between Manilla and the
South seas, as they seem to think the whole riches of the mines will be
centered in China, with which this court has no trade. This seems
probable enough since the expulsion of the Jesuits, as it was through
their interests that trade has so long subsisted; and what confirms it
the more is, that the court will not pay for the additional
fortifications of that place (Manilla) since it has been given up by
the English. But if one may add his thoughts, I believe two or three
ships, properly authorised, to back the above demand, would be more
powerful intercessors.&rdquo; (<i lang="la">Ut supra</i>, 1767, p.
549.)</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;<i>London, Nov. 19.</i> A letter from
Madrid has this passage: &lsquo;Sir James Gray, the British Minister,
has already entered upon his negotiation, of which the Manilla affair
and the West-India commerce are the first objects.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;

conquest of Manila:</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Three distributions have been made of the
money hitherto received on account of the capture of Manila. The first
consisted of 526,306 Spanish dollars collected in specie, jewels, gold
and silver plate, and merchandise, received in part of the four
millions of dollars to be paid agreeable to the capitulation, including
the plunder taken from the seamen and soldiers after the conquest,
amounting to 496,000 dollars. The second arose from the balance of the
first account, and the amount of sundry naval, victualling and ordnance
stores, confiscated and secreted effects, amounting to 92,561 dollars
and a fraction. The third arose from the sale of vessels, merchandise,
naval and victualling stores, and confiscated effects, sold at Manila
and Fort St. George, amounting to 43,280 pagodas and a fraction. Of
each of these the East-India company received one third. Distribution
has also been made of the effects saved out of the Spanish galley
attacked and destroyed by three of the boats of the squadron in the bay
of Manila, amounting to 13,319 dollars and a fraction. The total
distribution to each class, being cast into Sterling money, comes out
thus:</p>

Marquis de Ayerbe says that the British soldiery left nothing of value
in the private houses, and rendered useless what they did not care to
carry away. They committed numberless atrocities. At the convent of St.
Dominic, they cut off the head of the Virgin of the rosary. They sacked
and profaned the churches. The archives of the Audiencia,
secretaryship, offices of the treasury, and many private papers, were
burned. They were aided by the servants of the Spaniards and the
natives who had come to defend the capital. On the petition of the
archbishop, guards were placed by Draper in the convent of the nuns of
Santa Clara and in the beaterios. That being done, Draper ordered the
sack for three hours, a period which was prolonged to more than forty.
The drunken soldiers violated the defenseless women, looted, destroyed,
and profaned the churches, being aided in this by the Chinese and
criminals who had been given their liberty. At the end of twenty-four
hours, the archbishop protested, but notwithstanding the orders of
Draper, the sack continued. The most inhuman deeds are said to have
been committed by the natives. See <i lang="es">Sitio y conquista</i>,

ordered whatever had been taken from the churches to be restored, but
nothing was found except some vestments taken by the Sepoys, who
appeared on the walls dressed in the same. Especially were the sacred
places treated with deep respect. The religious were allowed to return
to their convents, in an endeavor to gain their powerful influence.
Especially did he try to win over the Augustinian ex-provincial Remijio
Hernandez, then in charge of the province, writing him several letters.
But he was unable to obtain his desire, for Hernandez remained firm in
his loyalty. See Mas, i, pp. 134, 135, 137.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

letter written to the <i>London Chronicle</i>, and published in that
paper, for the issue of December 27&ndash;29, 1764, no. 252, p. 618,
attests the humanity of General Draper. The writer, an eyewitness of
the storming of Manila, asserts that Draper took very careful
precautions to avoid the excesses that are liable to occur at such a
time, with the miscellaneous troops under his command. As soon as the
capitulation was in force, the chief men of Manila were allowed to
retire into the country to escape possible contagion from the carnage.
The writer denies any personal motive for the declaration, as he was
really at Manila against his will, and has no connection with army or
navy. &ldquo;The following is nearly an exact list of the troops, that
were employed on that expedition: 500 regulars, Mr. Draper&rsquo;s own
regiment; 250 Marines; 500 seamen; 600 Seapoys (black troops); 250
French, who, to be free of a prison, had entered into the
Company&rsquo;s service&mdash;a total of 2,100. The increasing these to
4000, and representing them as let loose to every degree of rapine,
after the capitulation, are both equally unjust, and carry their
conviction; nor can there be any greater evidence of Mr. Draper&rsquo;s
humanity and presence of mind, than that with such a body of troops he
should restrain their impetuosity at such a period.&rdquo; If the
Spaniards fail in paying the ransom, they should surrender the city in
the condition in which it was at the time of the
surrender.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd27e5179src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p>After our misfortunes which happened at the capture of Manila by the
English, we are breathing a bit. Hardships have not been lacking here
since then, but they have been accompanied by relief.</p>
<p>Last year it was God&rsquo;s will to bring us safely the ship
&ldquo;Santa Rosa&rdquo; with peace signed and a new governor <i lang=

"xd27e5374src" href="#xd27e5374" name="xd27e5374src">1</a> As no other
boat was left, the said &ldquo;Santa Rosa&rdquo; was fitted up and now
it has returned to us, bringing us the regularly-appointed governor Don
Francisco Raon. This is the beginning of the recuperation of these
islands.</p>
<p>For the rest, one could have feared the total ruin of these domains,
according to the unbridled manner in which the Moros were killing and
capturing through the Bisayas. The governor <i lang="la">ad interim</i>
has placed Manila in a state of the best defense against European
powers, and has opened about it a very wide ditch and made some very
high intrenchments. If eight thousand Europeans were necessary to
capture it before now fourteen or sixteen thousand will be necessary.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=

<p>There is no doubt but that the present governor will perfect these
works, and that he will more eagerly check the boldness of the
Morillos.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5385src" href="#xd27e5385" name=
"xd27e5385src">2</a> That being done, the trade of Bisayas will again
flourish, which is almost necessary for the conservation of this
capital.</p>
<p>God has placed a very heavy hand upon our friends the English in
their retirement. It is enough to say that seven of their fourteen
ships have been lost, and one-half the men whom they brought here, who
numbered in all about eight thousand. Of a truth their hopes saw a
sorry fulfilment. <i>Cruel Micenas, fugitibo Eneas, etc.</i></p>
<p>Concerning the unhappy condition of the missions of the empire of
China, your Reverence will already have had accurate information
through the Portuguese fathers who were ordered to be taken to Europa

scattered through its vast provinces. Those of the court are living
openly with the license of the emperor and the rest are keeping hid.
But all lack the aid which formerly was sent to them from Goa. May God

<p>I am writing this letter, in doubt as to the arrival of your

from the abominations in which we are. Don Francisco Xavier [de la]
Torre is the most detestable robber ever seen in the East or West
Indias, a man without shame or trace of Christianity. All this might be
tolerated if he took any care of the defense of the Indians; but he has
wholly abandoned the fields of Christendom, saying that a cornucopia of
the islands is given to him, and that the king our sovereign will
abandon them, or transfer them to the French. Thereupon, he has given
himself over to a libertine life, so far as his morals are concerned.
He looks after nothing else than selling the offices dear, and robbing
king and vassals. He obtains it all with abun[dant]<a class="noteref"

he answered that the last thing that leaves the body is the soul. What
can such governors, [such] auditors, and such alcaldes occasion, if not
the ruin of the community?</p>
<p>Not less ruined are the Bisayas, as they are without stipends, and
cannot be helped from here, since they have no boats which can resist
the Moros, for the governor has not made a grain of powder nor a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>single boat, although it is a fact that he has
cost the king almost a million pesos. The fathers are compelled to go
almost naked, and they have had to make shoes out of the parchment of
their books. They have been assisted as much as possible, and already
those missions owe thirty thousand pesos to the province. Of the ten
churches built of stone and mortar, and a like number of houses in the
residence of Hilongos, only two are left, and all the rest are ruined
and burned by the Moros. Your Reverence may conjecture almost the same
thing of other less defensible villages. All [the inhabitants of] the
two villages which were formed under the charge of Samboangan are dead
or captives, and I am sure that the missions of the Recollects have
suffered greater ruin, <i lang="la">proportione servata</i>; for I am
told that the entire jurisdiction of Caraga is reduced to one thousand
tributes. Since your Reverence left, one-half the Indians of Bisayas
have been captured or killed. May God bring us a governor, may God
bring us some auditors, who shall recognize and appreciate the defense
of the Catholic religion and of the poor Indians!</p>
<p>The estates of Calatag&aacute;n and Looc, burned and sacked by the
Moros; the estates of Meysilo and La Piedad, burned and sacked by the
Christians; that of San Pedro Tunasan, sacked by the Indians, commanded
by six Franciscan friars; Lian and Nasugb&uacute; delivered to the
Joloan [? <i>Jelaco</i> in transcript] king by treaty; that of Naic
abandoned to the robbers; San Pedro Macati burned by the English, with
the exception of the house and church! Those which have suffered less
are Marquina, Payatas, and Calamba, although they have suffered
considerably. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=

<p>Don Manuel Fernandez Thoribio has been appointed governor of
Samboangan, and has secret instructions to ascertain what estates and
what manner of livelihood the Jesuits have. In general, all the
alcaldes who have been sent out carry instructions against the
regulars. The fact is that stipends are not to be paid to the
ministers, and no alms or aid is to be given to carry on the
missions.</p>
<p>Since my arrival, neither from the royal treasury of Mexico, nor
from these [in Manila], has the least stipend [been given] to the four
subjects in Samboangan &hellip; treasury, by royal decree, that they be
paid here, and from those of here, for &hellip; in order to pay from
the treasury of Mexico. Consider, your Reverence, what must be the
condition of this po[or] province.</p>
<p>There is another war declared, in which Se&ntilde;or Galban has
unfurled the banner against [the] pious [funds]. He declares that the
pious funds are the ruin of [trade] and of the islands; as if the trade
of the islands had any other foundation. I, &hellip; procurator, have
come to the opinion that God is abandoning this His kingdom; &hellip; I
doubt that on other occasions, there may have been greater or equal
mi[sfortunes], but surely, the ministers of the king, our sovereign,
must have had more application and better intentions. It might be that
Se&ntilde;or Cegado has them, since he is &hellip; it. They pass no
measure that is not intended for the ruin, and tell &hellip; the
liberty in which they live, would be to paint a detesta[ble] and
scandalous community.</p>
<p>Against us in particular, is aroused a very perplexing storm,
&hellip; the case, that in the college of Manila, a [mis]sion was held
during Lent. On the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340"
name="pb340">340</a>]</span>next to the last day, Father Puch explained
the seventh command[ment] and named the kinds of robbers that existed.
He named alcaldes-[mayor?] of provinces, adding what St. Xavier said of
these at seeing &hellip; that they received the decree <i lang=
"la">deleantur de libro viventium</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5480src" href="#xd27e5480" name="xd27e5480src">3</a> On the
&hellip; day, while I was resting, I received a bloodthirsty
denunciation from Se&ntilde;or Galban, which I [sho]wed to Father Puch,
who explained on Sunday afternoon in great-detail what I have
mentioned, and what he ought to say. But on the third day, I received a
royal provision passed by an extraordinary meeting of the assembly, in
[which] they told [me] to censure Father Puch who was to be ordered to
give sat[isfaction] to the royal assembly, and to the public for the
excesses committed upon the alcaldes-mayor. The last two days of the
mission, I formed their &hellip; assessorship at the university of
Santo Thomas, and at four of the &hellip; all acquitted, and I with
them, Father Puch. Thereupon, I presented myself before the royal
assembly on the twenty-seventh [of] March, and they have been silent
until now. They gave the matter for review to the fiscal, who presented
himself in person on the seventeenth of May with a fiscal review, in
which he censures and reproves my conduct, and reproves and censures
that of Father Puch. He censures all the religious orders, for, he
says, we are all united in incriminating the alcaldes-mayor; that there
is no obedience to the king in the islands; that the religious are the
masters of the islands, despotic, tyrannical, cruel. He requests the
royal assembly to reproduce before the king our sovereign, the memorial
of Palafox against <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341"
name="pb341">341</a>]</span>the religious, and that secular priests be
assigned to the ministries; and that although the provision taken in
the royal assembly ought to be urged on me, and although another ought
to be despatched against the Dominicans, already the conspiracy of all
the religious is known, and that the royal assembly will obtain nothing
more than disrespect, disobedience, and insults, and that it will be
best to inform the king, our sovereign, of everything, passing by my
petition of testimony made in triplicate in order that I might have
recourse to his Majesty. I have seen nothing, and have been informed of
nothing. Thereupon, I sought my remedy, and have recourse with three
testimonies to the king, our sovereign. I greatly fear, however, that
the matter will be neglected in Madrid, and the connivance of our
procurators; but for this I also ask the remedy farther on.</p>
<p>A boat was built in Pangasinan in order that it might be sent to
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. It was launched in the middle of May in a river,
but it could not get out because of the bar. Means are being discussed,
hopes abound, but it is now considered impossible for a voyage to be
made this year. The &ldquo;Santa Rosa&rdquo; was expected at the end of
May, but we are sure that there will be no voyage unless one of the
ships from the mainland is bought. If the &ldquo;Santa Rosa&rdquo;
brings no money we must all go to live in Visayas and Tagalos. To this
point have I come, today, June 17. If there is anything to add later, I
will add it in a separate paragraph, or in another letter.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Santa Rosa&rdquo; arrived July 3, with the new governor.
The &ldquo;Santa Rosa&rdquo; is being prepared for its return trip to
M&eacute;xico, for the ship of Azevedo has not arrived, and is not
expected, although it left the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342"
href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>bar on the third of this said
month. The boat of Misamis is being equipped for M&eacute;xico. I do
not consider it necessary to give instructions to your Reverence, for I
expect that without them, you will perform the duties of your post
fully, and our friendship.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz, July 20, 1765.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
